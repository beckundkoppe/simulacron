content='To place the cucumber on the table, I need to move close to the cucumber and then pick it up before moving to the table\'s position. After reaching the table, I should drop the cucumber onto it.\n\nLet me break this down into steps:\n1. Move next to the cucumber at pos (3.5, 1.5).\n2. Take the cucumber from the floor.\n3. Move next to the table at pos (3.5, 0.5).\n4. Drop the cucumber onto the table.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that all actions are executable and minimal. Therefore, I need to confirm with the environment details to ensure I\'m not missing anything.\n\nStep 1: The cucumber is located at position (3.5, 1.5). The human can move directly there by specifying these coordinates in a move_to_position command.\n\nStep 2: Once next to the cucumber (i.e., within some proximity threshold), the take_from command is used with the what_id set to "cucumber_3" and from_id as \'FLOOR\' because the cucumber is on the floor according to the perception data.\n\nStep 3: The table is at position (0.5,1.5) — no wait, looking back at the percepetion it\'s (3.5, 0.5). I can move there directly with another move_to_position command.\n\nStep 4: With the cucumber in inventory and next to the table, drop it by using the drop_to command where what_id is "cucumber_3" and to_id is "table_4" (the table\'s ID).\n\nBut wait, looking at the room parameters the human can simply walk to the new position without needing intermediate steps since the room is small enough.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal move would be:\n1. Take the cucumber directly from its location.\n2. Drop it onto the table if already adjacent.\n\nBut according to the task "None" is returned as the inventory or the human\'s context has changed. I assume this means that the perception data provided initially is the current state, and the agent must act upon it in sequence.\n\nThus, no intermediate position tracking is needed beyond what’s necessary for the actions. The human starts at (0.0, 0.0) but since we do not have precise parameters on how close you need to be to interact with an object, I assume close enough means next to them.\n\nSo the steps can be abstracted to:\n1. move_to_position (3.5, 1.5)\n2. take_from what=cucumber_3 from=FLOOR.\nBut wait no, we are at (0.0) initially and need to go to where the cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5).\nThen after picking it up,\n3 move to  table position(3.5, 0.5)\n4 drop the cucumber onto to_id=table_4.\n\nThis sequence achieves minimal actions in terms of movement and interaction.\nTherefore, the API calls would be:\n\n' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 660, 'prompt_tokens': 1279, 'total_tokens': 1939, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-154', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019afb51-a41c-70b0-9621-1fe7ef0810aa-0' tool_calls=[{'name': 'move_to_position', 'args': {'x': 3.5, 'y': 1.5}, 'id': 'call_sn28pdan', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1279, 'output_tokens': 660, 'total_tokens': 1939, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
