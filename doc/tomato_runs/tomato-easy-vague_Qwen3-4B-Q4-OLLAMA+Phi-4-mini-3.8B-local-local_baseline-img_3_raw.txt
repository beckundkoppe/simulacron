            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': '{"name": "MoveTo"', 'args': [{'name': 'x', 'value': '2'}, {'name': 'y', 'value': '1"}}  \n{"name": "PlaceBox", "args": {"object_id": "tomato'}, {'name': 'shelf', 'value': '7"}'}]}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}. Keep tool calls minimal.

content='ﹻ\nOkay, let\'s tackle this problem. The user has a task where they need to move to a specific location and place a box on a shelf. The previous attempt had an error in the tool call, specifically with the MoveTo tool. The correct syntax should be using the MoveTo tool with x=2 and y=1, then using the PlaceBox tool with the object_id "tomato" and shelf 7.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the MoveTo tool is correctly called with the right parameters. The original attempt had a syntax error where the JSON was not properly formatted. The correct MoveTo should have the name "MoveTo" and args with x and y as integers. Then, after moving, the PlaceBox tool should be called with the object_id and shelf. \n\nI should check if the shelf is correctly specified as 7, which is a string in the tool call. Also, the object_id is "tomato", which is correct. The user mentioned that the previous tool call failed because of an unknown tool, but in this case, the tools are MoveTo and PlaceBox, which should be valid. \n\nSo the correct tool calls should be two separate tool calls: first MoveTo with x=2 and y=1, then PlaceBox with object_id "tomato" and shelf "7". I need to make sure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotes and commas. Also, the args for MoveTo should be a dictionary with x and y as keys. \n\nLet me structure that properly. The first tool call is MoveTo with x=2 and y=1. The second is PlaceBox with object_id "tomato" and shelf "7". No other tools are needed here. The user\'s answer should only include these two tool calls in the correct order.\n</think>\n\n{"name": "MoveTo", "args": {"x": 2, "y": 1}}  \n{"name": "PlaceBox", "args": {"object_id": "tomato", "shelf": "7"}}' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'created_at': '2025-12-04T07:23:50.484549876Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 4231250079, 'load_duration': 42620698, 'prompt_eval_count': 4096, 'prompt_eval_duration': 499214327, 'eval_count': 423, 'eval_duration': 3610990825, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--53fee77d-4cab-4092-9dfd-120af0478232-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4096, 'output_tokens': 423, 'total_tokens': 4519}

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool

[action_imaginator] - Move from 1 and place in position of the first extended x coordinate with value as input parameter.

  - Take out all remaining un flex count values for each object which is not present on room inf array using function get sequential number starting at index zero. The output will be a list containing data separated by semi colons (e.g. A:1 B:2 C:3 D:4 E:5 F and 0 as input parameter with value of extended y coordinate for each object which is not present on room inf array using function get sequential number starting at index zero.

 - Add remaining un flex count values to the output list in order from first (A) through last one (F).

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': 'MoveObject', 'args': {'object_id': 'tomato_001', 'target_container': 'container_001'}}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}. Keep tool calls minimal.
