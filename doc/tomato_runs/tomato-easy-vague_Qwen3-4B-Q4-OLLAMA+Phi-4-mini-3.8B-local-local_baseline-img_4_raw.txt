            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': 'MoveTo', 'args': [{'name': 'arg0', 'value': 'x=chest6_right'}, {'name': 'arg1', 'value': 'y=0'}]}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}; toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': 'MoveTo', 'args': [{'name': 'arg0', 'value': 'x=2'}, {'name': 'arg1', 'value': 'y=1'}]}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}; toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': 'PlaceBox', 'args': [{'name': 'arg0', 'value': 'object_id="tomato"'}, {'name': 'arg1', 'value': 'shelf=7'}]}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}. Keep tool calls minimal.

content='ᰍ\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wants me to generate the correct tool calls for the task. The previous attempt had some errors, like unknown tools. The main steps are moving to a position and placing a box.\n\nFirst, I need to use the MoveTo tool. The correct parameters should be x and y coordinates. The user mentioned moving to chest6_right and y=0, but maybe that\'s not the right syntax. Wait, the error said "unknown tool", so maybe the tool name is wrong. The correct tool is probably "MoveTo" with arguments for x and y. Let me check the syntax again.\n\nIn the retry, the user provided an example of a tool call: {"name": "MoveTo", "args": {"arg0": "x=chest6_right", "arg1": "y=0"}}. But that might not be correct because the tool might expect numerical values. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are in a different format. The user also tried moving to x=2, y=1, which is probably correct for the target position.\n\nThen, after moving, the PlaceBox tool should be used with the object_id as "tomato" and shelf=7. The previous attempt had that, but maybe the syntax needs to be adjusted. The correct tool call for PlaceBox would have the object_id and shelf as arguments.\n\nSo, the correct sequence is first moving to the correct position (maybe x=2, y=1) and then placing the box. But the user\'s initial attempt had a MoveTo to chest6_right, which might be a wrong coordinate. The correct target is probably (2,1). So the tool calls should be:\n\n1. MoveTo with x=2, y=1\n2. PlaceBox with object_id="tomato" and shelf=7\n\nI need to make sure the tool names are correct and the arguments are properly formatted. The user\'s previous attempt had the MoveTo with x=chest6_right, which might be a wrong parameter. So the correct tool calls are the two I mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{"name": "MoveTo", "args": {"arg0": "x=2", "arg1": "y=1"}}  \n{"name": "PlaceBox", "args": {"object_id": "tomato", "shelf": "7"}}' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'created_at': '2025-12-04T07:41:11.154517358Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 4710751946, 'load_duration': 42726489, 'prompt_eval_count': 4096, 'prompt_eval_duration': 499323897, 'eval_count': 483, 'eval_duration': 4082693027, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--4372b60f-1dba-4260-98fe-430a2493238c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4096, 'output_tokens': 483, 'total_tokens': 4579}

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool

[action_imaginator] - Move from 1 and place in position of the first extended x coordinate with value as input parameter.

  - Take out all remaining un flex count values for each object which is not present on room inf array using function get sequential number starting at index zero. The output will be a list containing data separated by semi colons (e.g. A:1 B:2 C:3 D:4 E:5 F and 0 as input parameter with value of extended y coordinate for each object which is not present on room inf array using function get sequential number starting at index zero.

 - Add remaining un flex count values to the output list in order from first (A) through last one (F).

The end of packing the results is done, and now I can share this with you. Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
             Retry with these corrections: toolcall failed: unknown tool
{'name': 'UseTool', 'args': {'tool_id': 'packer_001', 'object_id': 'tomato_001'}}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}. Keep tool calls minimal.
