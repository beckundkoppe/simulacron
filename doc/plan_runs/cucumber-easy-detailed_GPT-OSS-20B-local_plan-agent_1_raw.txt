| Object | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) |

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber is indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The path from the human’s start position (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5) is clear and the human can move there.

**Verification of assumptions**

- **Assumption 1**: Correct – the cucumber’s stated location matches the human’s new position.  
- **Assumption 2**: Correct – the move was successfully executed, indicating no obstacles.

**What was achieved / not achieved**

- The human has reached the cucumber but has **not** picked it up.  
- The cucumber has **not** been placed on the table.  

Thus, the action advanced the task partially but the remaining steps (pick‑up and placement) are still required.
