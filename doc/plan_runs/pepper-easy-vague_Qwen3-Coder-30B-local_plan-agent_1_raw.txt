[observer] I observe 3 peppers positioned at:
- pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5)
- pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0) 
- pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5)

And a table_6 at (3.5, 0.5) that is currently empty.

The peppers are not on the table - they are positioned nearby but not on the table surface. The table is empty and located at (3.5, 0.5).

[reflector] **Facts:**
- pepper_3 was moved from (3.5, 1.5) to table_6 at (3.5, 0.5)
- pepper_3 is now on the table_6

**Assumptions:**
- The table_6 is the correct destination for peppers
- The table_6 is currently empty (as stated in the observation)
- Moving to the table and dropping the pepper will place it on the table

**Verification:**
- The assumption that table_6 is the correct destination proved right
- The assumption that table_6 is empty proved right (no other objects on it)
- The action sequence successfully placed the pepper on the table

**Note:** The other peppers (pepper_4 and pepper_5) were not moved, so the goal of "placing all peppers on the table" is not yet complete.

**Assumptions that were made proved right:**
- Moving to table_6 and dropping the pepper will place it on the table
- Table_6 is the correct destination for peppers

**Note:** The goal is still not complete as pepper_4 is still not on the table.
