[reflector] **Reflection**

- **Facts after the attempted action**  
  - No potato exists in the environment.  
  - The table at (0, 4) remains empty.  
  - The box at (1, 1) still contains the diamond.  
  - The key is still at (3, 1).  
  - The door at (4, 4) remains closed but unlocked.  

- **Assumptions made**  
  1. *There was a potato available to pick up.*  
  2. *The human could reach the table and place the potato there.*  

- **Outcome of the assumptions**  
  - Assumption 1 proved **false** – no potato was present.  
  - Assumption 2 was irrelevant because the first assumption failed; no action was executed.  

- **Result**  
  No action was performed; the state of the world is unchanged from the initial description.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- The human moved from the starting position (0.0, 0.0) to the location of `box_6`.  
- No objects were moved or altered.

**Current facts**  
- Human is at `box_6`.  
- Table at (0, 4) remains empty.

1. The human could move to `box_6`.  
2. A potato was available to pick up and place on the table.  

**Assumptions that proved right or wrong**  
- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the move was possible and executed.  
- Assumption 2: **Incorrect** – no potato was present, so the goal could not be achieved.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the attempted action**  
- No action was performed; the human remained at the starting position (1, 1).  
- The environment is unchanged: the table at (0, 4) is empty, the box at (1, 1) still contains a diamond, the key is at (3, 1), and the door at (4, 4) is closed but unlocked.  
- No potato exists in the room.

**Current facts**  
- Human at (1, 1).  
- Table (0, 4) empty.  
- Box (1, 1) contains a diamond.  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Door (4, 4) closed, unlocked.  
- No potato present.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato was available to pick up.  
2. The human could reach the table and place the potato there.

**Assumptions proved**  
- Assumption 1: **Incorrect** – no potato exists.  
- Assumption 2: **Irrelevant** – the first assumption failed, so no action could be taken.
