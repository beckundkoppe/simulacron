| Object | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) |

**Assumptions made**

1. **The human is now at the cucumber’s location.**  
   *Proved right.* The move command succeeded.

2. **The cucumber remains where it was (not moved).**  
   *Proved right.* No pick‑up or placement action was performed.

3. **The table is still empty and unchanged.**  
   *Proved right.* No interaction with the table occurred.

4. **The cucumber is now on the table.**  
   *Proved wrong.* The cucumber is still at (3.5, 1.5), not on the table at (3.5, 0.5).

**Summary**

The action achieved the minimal step of getting the human to the cucumber, but it did not accomplish the goal of placing the cucumber on the table. The only incorrect assumption was that the cucumber would be on the table after this move.

2. Cucumber remains where it was (not moved). ✅ Correct  
3. Table is unchanged. ✅ Correct  
4. Cucumber is now on the table. ❌ Incorrect – it is still at (3.5, 1.5).  

**Summary**  
The human moved to the cucumber, but the cucumber has not yet been placed on the table.
