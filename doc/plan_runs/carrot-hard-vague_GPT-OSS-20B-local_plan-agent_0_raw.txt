[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.0, 4.0).  
- No other objects changed state.  
- The table at (1.0, 4.0) remains empty.  
- The carrot stays in the human’s inventory.

**Current facts**

| Object | State |
|--------|-------|
| Human | at (1.0, 4.0) |
| Carrot | in inventory |
| Table (1.0, 4.0) | empty |

**Assumptions made (and their status)**

| Assumption | Relevance to action | Status |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| The table at (1.0, 4.0) is empty | Needed to know the target location is free | **Proved true** |
| The human can pick up the carrot | Not used in this move | Unverified |
| The human can place the carrot on the table | Not used in this move | Unverified |

**Summary**

The move action succeeded, confirming that the human can reach the table and that the table was indeed empty. The assumptions about picking up and placing the carrot remain untested.
