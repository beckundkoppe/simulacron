[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber was at (3.5,1.5), table at (3.5,0.5).  
- Movement to cucumber's location succeeded.  
- Cucumber was collected.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Path to cucumber is unobstructed (confirmed).  
- Table is accessible and empty (confirmed).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Movement and collection worked as expected.  
- No obstacles blocked the path or table access.  

**Next Step:** Move to table (3.5,0.5) and drop cucumber.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Cucumber is now on the table at (3.5,0.5).  

**Facts:**  
- Cucumber was successfully picked up and moved to the table.  
- Table is now occupied by the cucumber.  

**Assumptions (new state):**  
- Table can accept the cucumber (confirmed).  
- No obstacles block the drop (confirmed).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- All prior assumptions (path, table access) remain correct.  
- No errors occurred in movement or placement.  

**Result:** Cucumber is placed on the table. Goal achieved.
