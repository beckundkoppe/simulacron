[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

| Item | Location / State |
|------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) – standing on the cucumber’s spot, not holding anything |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) – still on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Potato | (0.5, 1.5) – unchanged |
| Chest | (2.0, 2.0) – closed, unlocked, empty |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

| Assumption | Status |

| Cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5) | **Correct** |
| Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and empty | **Correct** |
| Human can pick up the cucumber | **Unverified** (action not performed) |
| Human can place the cucumber on the table | **Unverified** (action not performed) |
| Cucumber has been collected (as indicated by “collected cucumber_3”) | **Wrong** – cucumber remains on the floor |

**Summary**

- The only effect of the performed action was moving the human to the cucumber’s location.  
- The cucumber was not picked up or placed on the table.  
- The assumptions about the cucumber’s location and the table’s emptiness were confirmed.  
- The assumption that the cucumber was collected is false; the pick‑up and placement actions were never executed.
