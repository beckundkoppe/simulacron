[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- **Fact:** The human moved from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.0, 4.0).  
- **Fact:** The carrot remains in the human’s inventory.  
- **Fact:** The table at (1.0, 4.0) is still empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. *The human reached the table location.* – **Correct.**  
2. *The carrot was placed on the table.* – **Incorrect.** The action only moved the human; it did not drop the carrot.  
3. *The table was empty before the action.* – **Correct.**  

Thus, the only assumption that proved wrong was that the carrot had been placed on the table.
