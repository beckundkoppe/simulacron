Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- No objects were moved or altered.  
- The environment remains exactly as described:  
  - Door at (4.0, 4.0) is closed.  
  - Box at (1.0, 1.0) still contains a diamond.  
  - Table at (0.0, 4.0) is still empty.  
  - Key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
  - No potato is present anywhere.

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Potato exists in the other room | Not found | **Wrong** |
| Door is closed | Confirmed | **Right** |
| Key is at (3.0, 1.0) | Confirmed | **Right** |
| Table is empty | Confirmed | **Right** |
| Box contains a diamond | Confirmed | **Right** |

**Summary**

The attempted actions had no effect because the target object (potato) was absent. All other environmental facts remained unchanged, confirming the correct assumptions about the door, key, table, and box. The only incorrect assumption was that a potato existed in the other room.

- No objects were moved or altered. The environment stayed exactly as described.

**Current facts**  
- Door at (4.0, 4.0) is closed.

**Current facts**  
- Agent location: (4, 4).  
- Door at (4, 4): open (and was already unlocked).  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Box at (1, 1) contains a diamond.  
- Table at (0, 4) remains empty.  
- No potato is present.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
- The door is now open.  
- The agent is at (4, 4).  
- All other objects keep their previous positions and properties.

**Assumptions proved right**  
- Door at (4, 4) is open.  
- Agent is at (4, 4).  
- Key, box, table, and lack of potato remain unchanged.  

No assumptions were proved wrong.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the actions**  
- Agent moved from (0,0) to (4,4).  
- The door at (4,4) was already unlocked and is now open.

**Current facts**  
- Agent location: (4, 4).  
- Door at (4, 4): open (and unlocked).  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Box at (1, 1) contains a diamond.  
- Table at (0, 4) is empty.  
- No potato is present.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
- The door was unlocked before opening.  
- The agent is now at (4, 4).  
- All other objects remain unchanged.

**Assumptions proved right**  
- Door unlocked.  
- Agent at (4, 4).  
- Door open.  
- Key, box, table, and absence of potato unchanged.  

No assumptions proved wrong.
