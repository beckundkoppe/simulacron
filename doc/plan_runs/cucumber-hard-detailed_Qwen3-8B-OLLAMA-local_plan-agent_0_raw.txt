[observer] You observe a cucumber at (3.5,1.5) and an empty table at (3.5,0.5). The cucumber is in the same x-position as the table but higher up. No other objects block the path.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber collected at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5,0.5), same x-coordinate.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Agent can move directly to the table’s position (no obstacles).  
- Dropping the cucumber on the table is possible.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Movement to the cucumber’s location worked (confirmed by action).  
- Path to the table is unobstructed (explicitly stated).  

**Next Steps:**  
Move to (3.5,0.5) and drop the cucumber on the table.
