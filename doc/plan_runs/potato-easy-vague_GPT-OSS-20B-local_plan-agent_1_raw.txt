Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the attempted action**

- The room contains no potato.  
- The table is present (we assumed it exists, but it was not explicitly verified).  

**Assumptions made**

1. A potato was available to pick up.  
2. The potato could be placed on the table.  

**Evaluation of assumptions**

- **Assumption 1** proved **false** – there was no potato in the room.  
- **Assumption 2** is moot because assumption 1 failed; we could not attempt to place a non‑existent object.  

**Effect of the performed actions**

- No action was taken (the system returned “Result: .”), so the state of the room remained unchanged.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The agent moved from (0, 3) to (4, 4).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or interacted with.

1. Agent is at (4, 4).  
2. Door at (4, 4) remains closed.

- The environment allows movement to the door’s location.

[reflector] **Effect of the attempted action**  
- No movement or manipulation occurred; the agent stayed at (0, 0).  
- The room state remained unchanged: no potato, table at (0, 3) empty, key at (3, 1), door at (4, 4) closed.

**Facts**  
1. The room contains no potato.  
2. The table exists at (0, 3) and is empty.  
3. The agent is at (0, 0) holding nothing.  
4. A key is at (3, 1).  
5. A door is at (4, 4) and is closed.

**Assumptions made**  
- A potato was available to pick up.  
- The potato could be placed on the table.

**Assumption evaluation**  
- Assumption 1: **False** – no potato was present.  
- Assumption 2: **Moot** – could not be tested because assumption 1 failed.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- The agent moved from (3, 1) to the table at (0, 3) (now at `table_5`).  
- No objects were picked up, placed, or otherwise altered.

**Current facts**  
1. The room contains no potato.  
2. The table is at (0, 3) and remains empty.  
3. A key is at (3, 1).  
4. The door is at (4, 4) and is closed.  
5. The agent is now at the table (`table_5`) with an empty inventory.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
- A potato existed and could be moved to the table.  

**Assumption evaluation**  
- The potato‑related assumption proved **false** (no potato is present).  
- The movement assumption proved **true** (the agent successfully reached the table).

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] door_6 is too far away to interact. Hint: Move closer to the object before interacting.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The agent tried to open the door at (4, 4) but the action failed because the door was out of reach.  
- No objects were moved or changed.

**Current facts**  
- Agent is at (3, 1).  
- Key is at (3, 1).  
- Table is at (0, 3) and remains empty.  
- Door is at (4, 4) and is still closed.  
- No potato is present in the room.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
- The door could be interacted with from the agent’s current location.  
- A potato existed and could be placed on the table (if the goal were to open the door).

**Assumption outcomes**  
- Door‑interaction assumption: **wrong** (door too far).  
- Potato‑existence assumption: **wrong** (no potato).  
- All other assumptions remain untested.
