[observer] I observe 3 peppers in the room:
- pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0)
- pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5) 
- pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5)

I also see a table at (3.5,0.5) and a chest at (2.0,2.0).

All peppers are on the table. I need to collect them first, then place them on the table. The table is already at the correct location.

[reflector] **Facts:**
- Successfully moved to pepper_5 location (3.5,1.0)
- Successfully collected pepper_5
- Pepper_5 is now in inventory

**Assumptions:**
- Pepper_5 was on the table (as stated in the goal)
- The table is at (3.5,0.5) and is the correct destination
- No other peppers needed to be collected first

**Verification:**
- Assumption proved right: Pepper_5 was indeed at (3.5,1.0) and was collectable
- Assumption proved right: The table location (3.5,0.5) is correct for placing peppers
- Assumption proved wrong: The problem statement said "All peppers are on the table" but I was asked to "collect all peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table" - this suggests they were initially on the floor, not on the table. However, the observation shows them on the table, so the goal is to collect them and then place them on the table (which they already are).

The actions were correct and the state is now: pepper_5 is in inventory, other peppers still on table.

[observer] I observe:
- pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5) - this is a new pepper to collect
- pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5) - this is another new pepper to collect
- table_6 at (3.5,0.5) - the target table for placement
- chest_7 at (2.0,2.0) - a chest that is closed and unlocked

The table is at (3.5,0.5) and is currently empty. I need to collect pepper_3 and pepper_4, then place all peppers on the table. I am currently at (3.5,1.0) where pepper_5 is located, but I already collected it. I need to move to collect the remaining peppers.

The relevant new discoveries are:
1. Two additional peppers (pepper_3 and pepper_4) that need to be collected
2. The table location (3.5,0.5) where all peppers will be placed
3. The chest location (2.0,2.0) which is irrelevant to the current goal

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
