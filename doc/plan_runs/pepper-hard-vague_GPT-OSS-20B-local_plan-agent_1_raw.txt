[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is now at coordinates **(3.5, 1)**.  
- The table remains **empty**.  
- The peppers are still wherever they were before (not on the table).

**Assumptions made**

1. Moving to (3.5, 1) places the human at the table.  
2. The peppers are now on the table.  
3. The goal “place all peppers on the table” has been achieved.

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong**

- **Assumption 1**: *Uncertain* – we don’t know the table’s exact location; the human may or may not be at the table.  
- **Assumption 2**: **Wrong** – no pick‑up or drop action was performed, so peppers remain elsewhere.  
- **Assumption 3**: **Wrong** – the goal was not achieved; only the human moved.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- Human moved from (3.5, 1.0) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or dropped.  
- The table and all other items remain where they were.

**Current facts**

2. No other objects moved or changed state.  
3. Pepper 6 remains at (3.5, 1.5) (not picked up).

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- Human moved from (3.5, 1.0) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or dropped.  
- The table and all other items remain where they were.

**Current facts**

| Object | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper_5 |
| Pepper 5 | on table |
| Pepper 6 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 7 | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Potato 8 | (0.5, 1.5) |
| Apple 9 | (3.5, 1.6) |
| Chest | (2.0, 2.0), closed |

**Assumptions made**

1. Human is now at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. No other objects moved or changed state.  
3. Pepper 6 remains at (3.5, 1.5) (not picked up).  

**Assumptions proved**

All three assumptions are **right** – the state matches the expectations.

**Goal status**

The goal “place all of the peppers on the table” is still **not achieved**; only pepper 5 is on the table.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human picked up **pepper_3** and it is now in the human’s inventory.  
- No other objects were moved or altered.  
- The table still contains only **pepper_5**.  
- **pepper_6** remains at (3.5, 1.5) (the same spot the human occupies).  
- All other items keep their previous locations.

2. The table remains unchanged (still only pepper_5).  
3. Pepper_6 remains at (3.5, 1.5).

- Human moved to (3.5, 1.5).  
- Picked up **pepper_3** (now in inventory).  
- No other objects were moved or altered.  
- Table still contains only **pepper_5**.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human moved from the table at (3.5, 0.5) to the spot at (3.5, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or dropped.  
- The table still holds only **pepper_5**.  
- Inventory remains **pepper_3**.  
- All other items stay where they were.

**Facts**  
| Object | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Inventory | pepper_3 |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper_5 |
| Pepper_5 | on table |
| Pepper_6 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper_7 | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Potato_8 | (0.5, 1.5) |
| Apple_9 | (3.5, 1.6) |
| Chest | closed |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Human is now at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Inventory still contains pepper_3.  
3. Table still contains only pepper_5.  
4. Pepper_6 remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
5. Pepper_7 remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
6. No other objects moved.  
7. Goal “place all of the peppers on the table” is still **not achieved**.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
All of the above assumptions are correct; the state is unchanged except for the human’s new position.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**  
- Human moved onto **table_6** (now at (3.5, 0.5)).  
- Inventory still holds **pepper_3**.  
- Table still contains only **pepper_5**.  
- All other objects stay where they were.

**Assumptions made**  
1. Human is now on table_6.  
2. Inventory unchanged (pepper_3 still inside).  
3. Table contents unchanged (only pepper_5).  
4. All other objects unchanged.

**Assumptions proved right** – all five assumptions hold.  
**Goal status** – “place all peppers on the table” still not achieved.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human moved to (3.5, 1.5).  
- The human’s inventory now contains **pepper_3** (it was picked up).  
- No other objects were moved or altered.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) still holds only **pepper_5**.  

**Current facts**  
- Human: (3.5, 1.5)  
- Inventory: pepper_3  
- Table: (3.5, 0.5) containing pepper_5

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Human is at (3.5, 1.5).

6. No other objects moved.  
7. Goal “place all peppers on the table” still not achieved.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
All of the above assumptions are correct; the state is unchanged except for the human’s position. No assumptions proved wrong.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human dropped the held **pepper 3** onto the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The table now holds two peppers: **pepper 5** (known) and **pepper 3** (new).  
- The human remains at (3.5, 1.5) and its inventory is now empty.  
- All other objects keep their previous positions.

**Facts**  
- Human: (3.5, 1.5)  
- Inventory: empty  
- Table (6): contains {pepper 5, pepper 3}

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (collected pepper_4)**  
- Human moved to (3.0, 1.5) and picked up pepper_4.  
- Inventory now contains **pepper_4**.  
- Pepper_4 is no longer at (3.0, 1.5); it has been removed from the world.  
- All other objects (pepper_5, pepper_3 on the table, pepper_7, pepper_6, potato_8, apple_9, chest) remain unchanged.  

**Current facts**  
- Human: (3.0, 1.5)  
- Inventory: pepper_4  
- Table (6): {pepper_5, pepper_3}  
- Pepper_7: (3.0, 1.5)  
- Pepper_6: (3.5, 1.5)  
- Potato_8: (0.5, 1.5)  
- Apple_9: (3.5, 1.6)  
- Chest: closed  

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Human is at (3.0, 1.5).  
2. Inventory contains pepper_4.  
3. Pepper_4 is no longer at (3.0, 1.5).  
4. Table contents unchanged.  
5. Goal “all peppers on the table” still not met.  

**Assumptions proved right**  
All of the above assumptions are consistent with the perception → **all proved right**. No wrong assumptions detected.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (collected pepper 4)**  
- Human moved to (3.0, 1.5) and picked up pepper 4.  
- Pepper 4 is no longer in the world; it is now in the inventory.  
- All other objects (pepper 5 & 3 on the table, pepper 7, pepper 6, potato 8, apple 9, chest) remain unchanged.  

**Current facts**  
| Object | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.0, 1.5) |

| Pepper 6 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Potato 8 | (0.5, 1.5) |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Human remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
2. Inventory contains pepper 4.  
3. Table still holds pepper 5 and pepper 3.  
4. Pepper 7, pepper 6, potato 8, apple 9, chest unchanged.  
5. Goal “all peppers on the table” still not met.
