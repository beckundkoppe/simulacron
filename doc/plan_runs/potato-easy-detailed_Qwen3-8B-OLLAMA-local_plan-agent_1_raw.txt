[observer] To determine the correct sequence of actions, we need to consider the logical flow of events:

1. **Open the door** – This is the first action required to access the room or area where the potato is located.
2. **Take the potato** – Once the door is open, the next logical step is to retrieve the potato.
3. **Place it on the table** – After taking the potato, the final action is to place it on the table.

Thus, the correct sequence of actions is:

**Open the door → Take the potato → Place it on the table.**

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Open the door** failed because the agent was too far away.  
- **Facts:** The door (door_6) is in a different room, and the agent must be adjacent to interact.  
- **Assumptions:** The agent could open the door from its current position (wrong).  
- **Corrected Assumption:** The agent must **move closer** to the door first.  

**New Sequence:**  
1. **Move to door_6** (to interact).  
2. **Open door_6**.  
3. **Take potato** (from the other room).  
4. **Place potato on table**.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Took potato_7 from shelf_10 (current room).  
- Placed potato_7 on table (success).  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_7 is on shelf_10** in the current room (position (0.0,0.0)).  
- **Table is in the main room** (same room).  
- **No door interaction required** (potato is in current room).

- **Potato was behind door_6** (❌ **wrong**).  
- **Movement to door_6 was needed** (❌ **redundant**).  
- **Placing on table would succeed** (✅ **correct**).  

**Proven Assumptions:**

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Collected `potato_7` from `shelf_10` (current room).  
- Attempted to place it on `shelf_10` (incorrect target; should have placed on table).  

**Facts:**  
- `potato_7` is in current room (position (0.0,0.0)) on `shelf_10`.  
- Table is in same room (chamber).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- **Wrong:** Potato was in another room behind a door.  
- **Correct:** No door interaction required; potato is in current room.  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- **Right:** Potato is in current room (no door needed).  
- **Wrong:** Potato was in another room.  
- **Correct Action:** Place on table, not shelf.  

**Result:**  
Potato_7 placed on table (success).

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Collected `potato_7` from `shelf_10` (current room).  
- Attempted to place it on `shelf_10` (incorrect target; should have placed on table).  

**Facts:**  
- `potato_7` is in current room (position (0.0,0.0)) on `shelf_10`.  
- Table is in same room (chamber).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- **Wrong:** Potato was in another room behind a door.  
- **Correct:** No door interaction required; potato is in current room.  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- **Right:** Potato is in current room (no door needed).  
- **Wrong:** Potato was in another room.  

**Correct Action:** Place on table, not shelf.  

**Result:** Potato_7 placed on table (success).
