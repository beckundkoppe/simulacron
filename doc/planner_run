• [observer] You are in a main room with specific details: - **Size**: The room extends 4.0 units in both the x and y directions. - **Your Position**: You are at coordinates (1.0, 1.0). - **Inventory**: You have one item—a diamond. - **Perception Points**: - **Door**: Located at (4.0, 4.0). Might be an exit point. - **Shelf**: Immediate to you at (1.0, 1.0), open and unlocked but empty. - **Table**: Near the wall at (0.0, 4.0) with a key inside it. The key on the table is notable as it could be useful for further exploration or interaction within the room.

• [planner] ### Goals and Sub-Goals 1. **Collect All Valuable Items** (Completed) - Collect the diamond. - Completed 2. **Explore All Potential Areas** 2.1 **Search for Potatoes**: Find any potatoes in the room. - Uncompleted 2.2 **Unlock or interact with objects as possible**. - Uncompleted. 3.1. **Investigate Door** (4.0, 4.0) - Attempt to open. 3.1.1. Move towards the door. ### Structured Approach for Next Step 1. **Move Towards Door**: - The door at position (4.0, 4.0) might be an exit point or lead to another part of the area. - Since this is my initial exploration in a room with few clues as to where to find potatoes. 2. **Look For Potatoes in the Room** - Look around your surroundings while in transit to door (4, 4). 3. **Investigate Table for Interacting objects**: - The table at (0.0, 4.0) has a key. - If you get closer to the key, it may be of significance. ```markdown **In Inventory:** - Diamond id: diamond_6. ``` --- The structured approach ensures clear progress towards uncovering more details about the room and its potential items or exits while keeping everything organized and comprehensible.

Check contents of iron chest directly in front of you. * Use the key to unlock the chest: (`chest_13`). + Identify item inside `unlock_chest_with_id(chest_13)` * Place contents on self or table.

• Observation: 19

• [user] What do you observe? What is interesting? (short)

• [observer] You are in a chamber that is relatively small, with dimensions extending 1 meter by 3 meters. You are standing at the center of the chamber. Key observations: - There is a door to your north. - To the east there is an open shelf with a faint resin smell and one item on it—a black iron chest which is unlocked and empty. - Directly below you lies another chest—an easily bending cardboard box—which is also open but empty. Your inventory includes: two diamonds, a key, and a potato. The interesting part here might be the shelves where the boxes are placed since they could possibly hide something or lead to unlockable items when interacted with.
