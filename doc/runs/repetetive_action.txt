• [trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning** The plan “Leave the house” requires three things: 1. **Locate the main exterior door** – Door 23 has been found repeatedly. 2. **Open the door** – Door 23 has already been opened and remains unlocked. 3. **Step outside through that door** – The latest state shows the player standing **inside the hallway at (0.5, 0)**, right next to the open door, or in the chamber at (0.5, 1.5). In either case the player has **not moved into the garden area** yet. Since the final action taken was moving back into the hallway (still inside the house) and no step outside the door has occurred, the plan has **not** been completed.

• [trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning:** - The plan calls for three steps: (1) locate the exterior door 23, (2) open it, and (3) step through it to the garden. - The user has located door 23 and it is now **open and unlocked**. - However, the most recent location reported is the hallway at (0.5, 0), standing **inside** the house, right next to the open door. The user has not yet moved through the door into the garden. **Conclusion:** The plan is **not yet completed**; the final step of exiting through door 23 into the garden remains to be performed.

Reasoning: **No – the plan is not yet completed.** You have already located door 23, it is open and unlocked, and you are standing right next to it with the onion in your inventory. The final step of the plan – moving through door 23 to step outside into the garden – has not been performed yet. You need to go through the open exterior door to finish “leaving the house.” Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

mem: 3406/4048 (8096)

• [trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is still promising.** - The target exterior door 23 is already open and unlocked. - You are standing right next to it (in the chamber at 0.5, 1.5), so stepping through will immediately take you outside to the garden. - No new obstacles or door states have appeared that would block the exit. The remaining action is simply to move through door 23 to complete the “leave house” goal.
