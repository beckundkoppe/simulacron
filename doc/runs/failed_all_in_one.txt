• Observation: 0

• [user] Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

• [action_imaginator] To sort the list of numbers: $$ [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5] $$ we proceed step by step: --- ### **Step 1: Identify and Count Each Unique Number** Let's count how many times each number appears in the list: - **1** appears **2** times - **2** appears **1** time - **3** appears **2** times - **4** appears **1** time - **5** appears **3** times - **6** appears **1** time - **9** appears **1** time --- ### **Step 2: Arrange the Numbers in Ascending Order** We now arrange the numbers in ascending order, grouping duplicates together: - Start with the smallest number: **1** (2 times) - Next: **2** (1 time) - Then: **3** (2 times) - Followed by: **4** (1 time) - Then: **5** (3 times) - Next: **6** (1 time) - Finally: **9** (1 time) --- ### **Step 3: Construct the Sorted List** Putting it all together, the sorted list is: $$ [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9] $$ --- ### **Final Answer** $$ \boxed{[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]} $$
