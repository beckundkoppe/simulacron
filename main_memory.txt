    "\n\nThe performed actions have the following effects:  \n\n1. **Movement to (1.0,1.0):**  \n   You have relocated to the position of the shelf (`shelf_7`). This places you near the shelf, allowing interaction with it (e.g., opening it).  \n\n2. **Opening `shelf_7`:**  \n   The shelf, which was initially in a **closed** state, is now **open**. However, its contents are listed as **empty** (`[\"empty\"]`), meaning no items are visible or accessible here. The shelf’s description mentions it is \"filled with dust\" and has a \"faint smell of resin,\" but no tangible items are present.  \n\n3. **Key Location Note:**  \n   The key (`key_4`) is located on the table (`table_5`) at position `(0.0,4.0)`. Since you are currently at `(1.0,1.0)`, you would need to move to the table to retrieve the key.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Consider moving to the table to pick up the key.  \n- Check if other objects (e.g., the door at `(4.0,4.0)`) require interaction or items to proceed.  \n\nNo immediate rewards or changes occur from opening the shelf, but the action may be part of a larger puzzle or narrative."

The door might lead to a new location where the potato is hidden.\n\n3. **Search for the Potato:**  \n   After opening the door, check the adjacent area or any new objects revealed. The potato may be in a container, on a shelf, or in a hidden compartment.\n\n4. **Place the Potato on the Table:**  \n   Once the potato is found, return to the table at `(0.0,4.0)` and place it there to complete the goal.\n\n**Next Action:** Move to the table to pick up the key."
