    "\n\nYou're in a chamber with a door, a closed cardboard chest below, and a now-unlocked iron chest on a shelf. You hold a key and diamond, with the key no longer needed for the iron chest. The unlocked chest’s contents are now accessible, offering potential clues or items. Next steps could involve opening the chest, exploring the cardboard chest, or interacting with the door."

    "\n\nYou are at the door, which matches your position. A closed chest (chest_12) is below you, and an unlocked chest (chest_13) is on the shelf above. The key in your inventory might open the locked chest. The door’s position suggests it could be the exit."

    "\n\n**Updated Plan to Reach the Goal (Find the Potato and Place It on the Table):**\n\n1. **Open chest_13 (Black Iron Chest):**  \n   - Since it’s now unlocked, inspect its contents to determine if the potato is inside.  \n   - If found, take the potato and proceed to Step 2.  \n\n2. **If the potato is not in chest_13, check chest_12 (Cardboard Box):**  \n   - The cardboard chest is closed. Use the key (key_4) to unlock it (if not already unlocked).  \n   - Open it to check if the potato is inside.  \n\n3. **Locate the Table:**  \n   - The table’s position is unspecified in the current chamber description. Search the room (e.g., near the door, shelf, or chest_12) to find it.  \n   - If the table is not visible, it may be part of the environment (e.g., hidden or implied in the room’s description).  \n\n4. **Place the Potato on the Table:**  \n   - Once the potato is retrieved, move to the table and place it there to complete the goal.  \n\n5. **Optional: Interact with Door_9 or Other Objects:**  \n   - If the door requires a key or diamond (as the previous attempt failed), use the remaining items (diamond or key_4) to open it.  \n   - However, prioritize the potato and table first, as the goal explicitly mentions placing the potato.  \n\n**Key Priorities:**  \n- Focus on unlocking and inspecting chests (chest_13 and chest_12) to locate the potato.  \n- Ensure the table is identified and accessible before placing the potato.  \n- Use the key and diamond strategically, as they may be needed for other puzzles or the door.  \n\nThis plan balances exploration of available objects with the explicit goal of finding and placing the potato."
