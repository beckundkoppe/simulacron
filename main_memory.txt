    "**What happened?**\n\nYou tried to move through the door that’s sitting right in front of you, but the system rejected the action because you used the wrong operator.  \nIn this environment, “going through” a connector (like a door, gate, or hatch) is not a simple “move” command – it’s a *USE* action with the special operator **`GO_THROUGH`**.\n\n**Resulting state**\n\n- **Position**: Still at `(0.0, 1.0)` – you haven’t moved.\n- **Door**: Still present at `(0.0, 1.0)`. Its lock state isn’t shown, so we assume it’s either closed or locked; you haven’t interacted with it yet.\n- **Chest**: The open cardboard chest at `(0.0, 0.0)` remains empty.\n- **Shelf**: The pine shelf at `(0.0, 2.0)` still contains the black‑iron chest, which is open and empty.\n- **Inventory**: Unchanged – you still have the key, two diamonds, and a potato.\n\n**Next step**\n\nTo actually pass through the door, you need to issue a command like:\n\n```python\ninteract_with_object(\n    object_id=\"door_9\",\n    operator=\"GO_THROUGH\",\n    parameters={}\n)\n```\n\nIf the door is locked, you’ll first need to unlock it (e.g., `operator=\"UNLOCK\"` with the key). Once unlocked, the `GO_THROUGH` operator will move you to the other side of the connector (if there’s a room or space defined beyond it).\n\nFeel free to let me know what you’d like to do next—open the chest, unlock the door, or something else!"

    "**Short Plan to Reach the Goal**\n\n1. **Unlock the Door**  \n   - Use the key you’re carrying to unlock `door_9`.  \n   ```python\n   interact_with_object(object_id=\"door_9\", operator=\"UNLOCK\", parameters={\"key_id\":\"key_4\"})\n   ```\n\n2. **Pass Through the Door**  \n   - Once unlocked, go through the connector.  \n   ```python\n   interact_with_object(object_id=\"door_9\", operator=\"GO_THROUGH\", parameters={})\n   ```\n\n3. **Locate the Table**  \n   - In the next room (or area beyond the door), search for a table.  \n   - If the table is not immediately visible, use `look_around()` or `search()` to find it.\n\n4. **Place the Potato on the Table**  \n   - Once the table is identified, place the potato from your inventory onto it.  \n   ```python\n   interact_with_object(object_id=\"table_X\", operator=\"PLACE\", parameters={\"item_id\":\"potato_10\"})\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Success**  \n   - Confirm that the potato is now on the table (e.g., by inspecting the table’s contents).  \n   - If the goal is achieved, you’re done.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n- The door may already be unlocked, but it’s safest to attempt an unlock first.  \n- The `GO_THROUGH` operator is required to move through the door.  \n- The table is not in the current chamber; you’ll need to move to the next room.  \n- No other objects (chests, etc.) need to be interacted with for this goal."
