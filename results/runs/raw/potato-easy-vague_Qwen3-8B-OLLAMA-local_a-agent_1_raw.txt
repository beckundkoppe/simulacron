[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Unlocked Chest_9** with Key_4.  
- **Collected potato_7** from the chest.  
- **Moved to (0,3)** and **dropped potato_7** on the table.  

**Facts:**

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- The table exists at (0,3) (implied by room size).  
- "Unlock" is the correct operator for locked chests.  

**Proven Correct Assumptions:**  
- "Unlock" works on locked chests (replaced failed "open" command).  
- Potato_7 is accessible after unlocking.  

**Proven Wrong Assumptions:**  
- "Open" command works on locked chests (failed, replaced with "unlock").

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- The chest was unlocked using the key, emptied, and the potato was collected and placed at **(0.0, 3.0)** (implied table location).  
- The potato is now confirmed on the table, fulfilling the goal.  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_7** is at **(0.0, 3.0)** (table location).  
- **Chest_9** is unlocked and empty.  
- **Key_4** remains in inventory.  
- **shelf_10** at **(0.0, 0.0)** contains **Chest_9** (empty).  
- **Box_11** is empty at **(0.0, 2.0)**.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Table exists at **(0.0, 3.0)** (implied by room size).  
- Shelf_10 and Box_11 are valid locations.  
- Potato_7 is on the table (confirmed via coordinates).  

**Proven Correct Assumptions:**  
- "Unlock" works on locked chests.  
- Potato_7 is accessible after unlocking.  
- Potato_7 is on the table (confirmed).  

**Proven Wrong Assumptions:**  
- Chest_9 still contains Potato_7 (now empty).  
- Table was explicitly named (implied, not confirmed).  
- Potato_7 was placed on the table (correct, confirmed).  

**Result:** Goal achieved—**Potato_7** is on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**  
- **Potato_7** is in your inventory (not on the table or shelf).  
- **Table** location at **(0.0, 3.0)** is implied (matches your position) but not explicitly confirmed.  
- **Chest_9** (empty) is on **shelf_10** at **(0.0, 0.0)**.  
- **Box_11** is empty at **(0.0, 2.0)**.  

**Relevant for Goal:**  
The **potato_7** must be placed on the table (implied at **(0.0, 3.0)**), but it is currently in your inventory.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Place potato_7 at (0.0, 3.0) (implied table location).

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
