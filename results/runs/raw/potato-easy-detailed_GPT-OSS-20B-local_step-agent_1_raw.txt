[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- **Fact:** The human agent moved from position (0.0, 0.0) to position (4, 4).  
- **Assumptions made:**  
  1. The path from (0.0, 0.0) to (4, 4) was clear of obstacles.  
  2. The move was possible within the environment’s rules.  
  3. No other state changes (objects, doors, etc.) occurred as a result of this action.  

**Verification of assumptions**

- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the move succeeded, implying no blocking objects or closed doors along the route.  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – the action was accepted and executed.  
- Assumption 3: **Correct** – the only recorded change is the agent’s new location; no objects were moved or interacted with.

**Outcome relative to the goal**

- The goal was to *find the potato in the other room, take it, and place it on the table*.  
- The executed action only moved the agent; the potato remains in the other room, and it has not been taken or placed on the table.  
- Therefore, the goal has **not** been achieved.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human agent is now at position **(4, 4)**.  
- **door_6** (the door at (4, 4)) is now **open**.  
- The key remains at **(3, 1)**.  
- The table remains at **(0, 3)** and is still empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. The door at (4, 4) was **closed but unlocked**.  
2. Opening the door succeeded without affecting any other objects.  
3. No other state changes (objects moved, doors closed, etc.) occurred.

**Verification**

- **Assumption 1**: Correct – the door was indeed closed and unlocked.  
- **Assumption 2**: Correct – the door opened successfully.  
- **Assumption 3**: Correct – no other objects or states changed.

**Outcome relative to the goal**

The goal was to *find the potato in the other room, take it, and place it on the table*.  
The performed action only opened the door; the potato remains unseen and has not been moved or placed on the table. The goal has **not** been achieved.

[reflector] **Facts after the performed actions**

- The human agent is now in the other room (the chamber) at position (4, 4).  
- Door 6 at (4, 4) is open.  
- The key remains at (3, 1).  
- The table at (0, 3) is still empty.  
- No potato is visible in the chamber.

**Assumptions made**

1. Door 6 was closed but unlocked, so it could be opened.  
2. Opening the door does not alter any other objects or states.  
3. The agent’s movement through the door is possible and does not trigger other changes.

**Verification**

- **Assumption 1**: Correct – the door was indeed closed and unlocked.  
- **Assumption 2**: Correct – no other objects or states changed.  
- **Assumption 3**: Correct – the agent successfully entered the chamber.

**Outcome relative to the goal**

The goal was to *find the potato in the other room, take it, and place it on the table*.  
The performed actions only moved the agent into the chamber; the potato remains unseen, unpicked, and unplaced. The goal has **not** been achieved.

[reflector] **Facts after the executed actions**

- Agent is at position **(0, 3)**.  
- **potato_7** is on the table at (0, 3).  
- **chest_9** is now empty.  
- The table at (0, 3) is no longer empty.  
- The key remains at (3, 1).  
- The door at (4, 4) is open.  
- The box at (0, 2) still contains a diamond.  

**Assumptions made**

1. The chest at (0, 0) contained a potato.  
2. The potato could be collected from the chest.  
3. Moving from (0, 0) to (0, 3) was possible.  
4. Dropping the potato would place it on the table.  
5. The attempted interaction (first “ACTION FAILURE”) would affect an object.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all correct: the potato was in the chest, it was successfully collected, the move to (0, 3) succeeded, and the drop placed the potato on the table.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- 5 was wrong: the first interaction had no effect on any object.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- The agent moved from (0, 3) to (0, 2) and picked up the diamond that was inside the box at that location.  
- The diamond is now in the agent’s inventory; the box at (0, 2) is empty.  
- All other objects (potato on the table at (0, 3), empty chest, key at (3, 1), open Door 6) remain unchanged.  
- The agent stays at (0, 2).

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The agent can occupy cell (0, 2) without collision.  
2. Moving into the box cell does not disturb the potato, chest, key, or door.  
3. The diamond can be removed from the box and placed into the agent’s inventory.  
4. The box becomes empty after the diamond is taken.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The agent moved one step east from **(0, 2)** to **(1, 2)**.  
- No other objects were touched or altered.

**Current facts**

| Object      | State / Location |
|-------------|------------------|
| Agent       | (1, 2) |
| Potato      | on the table at (0, 3) |
| Chest       | empty |
| Key         | (3, 1) |
| Door 6      | open at (0, 1) |
| Box (0, 2)  | empty |
| Inventory   | diamond_8 |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The cell (1, 2) is free of obstacles, so the agent can occupy it.  
2. Moving into (1, 2) does not disturb the potato, chest, key, door, or box.  

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Both assumptions 1 and 2 were correct.

[reflector] **Effect of the last attempted action (move east from (0, 2) → (1, 2))**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Agent | remains at **(0, 2)** (move failed) |
| Inventory | diamond_8 |
| Potato | on table at (0, 3) |
| Chest | empty |
| Key | at (3, 1) |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. Cell (1, 2) is within the chamber bounds and free of obstacles.  
2. Moving into (1, 2) would not disturb any other objects.

**Assumptions that proved right / wrong**

- **Assumption 1** – **Wrong** (the move was blocked by the chamber wall).  
- **Assumption 2** – **Wrong** (the action could not be executed).  

All other facts remain unchanged.
