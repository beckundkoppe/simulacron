You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Goal: There are three spinach and three lettuce objects in the room. Spinach must go into the box, and lettuce must be placed in the shelf. For each item: move to it, pick it up, move to the correct target and place it.
Chosen action: move_to_object lettuce_9
Choice rationale: Lettuce_9 is the nearest remaining lettuce; pick it up and return to the shelf for placement, advancing the lettuce goal efficiently.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Goal: There are three spinach and three lettuce objects in the room. Spinach must go into the box, and lettuce must be placed in the shelf. For each item: move to it, pick it up, move to the correct target and place it.
Chosen action: move_to_object box_3
Choice rationale: After picking up a spinach item, the box is the required destination; moving there now keeps travel minimal.

[user] You are the execution policy of an agent in a dynamic graph.
You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Goal: There are three spinach and three lettuce objects in the room. Spinach must go into the box, and lettuce must be placed in the shelf. For each item: move to it, pick it up, move to the correct target and place it.
Chosen action: move_to_object spinach_5
Choice rationale: Spinach_5 is closest to the box; pick it up and place it in the box to start satisfying the spinach goal.

[user] You are the execution policy of an agent in a dynamic graph.
You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Each candidate must include: call (exact primitive tool call) and reason (why this is useful).
