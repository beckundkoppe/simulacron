Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The current plan lumps multiple actions into single steps (e.g., “put the tomato into the box and close the box”), and omits required navigation between objects. To execute, each action should be atomic and include necessary movements.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Decomposed plan (atomic actions):
1) Move to the table.
2) Take the tomato from the table.
3) Move to the box.
4) Put the tomato into the box.
5) Close the box.
6) Move to the chest.
7) Put the box into the chest.
8) Close the chest.
9) Move to the shelf.
10) Place the closed chest on the shelf.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here is a concise refinement of the current plan, breaking it into minimal primitive actions and ensuring feasible container handling.

Proposed refinements (decompose current plan [0]):
- [0.0] Retrieve the tomato from the table
  - Move to table
  - Take tomato

- [0.1] Place tomato into the box and close the box
  - Move to box
  - Open box
  - Put tomato into box
  - Close box

- [0.2] Move the box (with tomato inside) into the chest and close the chest
  - Move to chest
  - Open chest
  - Put box into chest
  - Close chest

- [0.3] Move the closed chest onto the shelf
  - Move to shelf
  - Place chest on shelf

Pruning/removal notes:
- No branches exist in the current plan; no pruning needed.
- If the environment already has open states assumed (e.g., boxes/chest considered open by default), you could skip the Open steps in [0.1] and [0.2], but include them as safe, explicit steps if needed.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan tree already breaks the goal into a linear sequence of primitive actions, with explicit preconditions satisfied (open before put, close after, etc.). Each subgoal maps to concrete actions, and there’s no need for branching or extra decomposition to execute.

Decision: Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: You moved from (0.0,0.0) to (1.0,4.0). No item was picked up; the tomato remains on the table.

- Current facts:
  - Agent at (1.0, 4.0); inventory: empty.
  - Tomato_3 is still on table_4 (table_4 contains 1 item).
  - All other objects unchanged: box_5 open at (3.0,3.0) and empty; chest_6 open at (4.0,1.0) and empty; cabinet_8 closed/unlocked at (0.5,1.5); shelf_7 empty; bin_9 empty; potatocarrot_10 at (4.5,0.5).

- Assumptions:
  - Assumed the move would succeed (correct).
  - Assumed the tomato would be picked up during this step (not performed; still on the table).

- Which assumptions proved right or wrong:
  - Right: Move action succeeded; tomato location unchanged.
  - Wrong: The plan included picking up the tomato in the same step; that pickup did not occur. The next action should be "Take tomato" to complete the retrieval.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief): The goal requires multiple actions after retrieving the tomato (put into the box, close the box, move the box into the chest, close the chest, and place the closed chest on the shelf). The current plan stops at retrieving the tomato, so it does not complete the objective.

Plan completed? No.

If you want, a complete minimal plan would be:
- Move to table_4; Take tomato_3.
- Move to box_5; Put tomato_3 into box_5; Close box_5.
- Move to chest_6; Put box_5 into chest_6; Close chest_6.
- Move to shelf_7; Place chest_6 on shelf_7.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected tomato_3 from table_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of actions:
- Tomato_3 was picked up from table_4 and is now in the agent’s inventory.
- Agent position remains at (1.0, 4.0).

New state (facts):
- Agent at (1.0, 4.0); inventory: [tomato_3]
- tomato_3 is in inventory; not on table_4
- table_4 contents_count = 0; contents = []
- box_5: open at (3.0, 3.0); empty
- chest_6: open at (4.0, 1.0); empty
- cabinet_8: closed/unlocked at (0.5, 1.5)
- shelf_7: empty
- bin_9: empty
- potatocarrot_10: at (4.5, 0.5)

Assumptions and verdicts:
- Move to table succeeds: right
- Tomato pickup occurs in this step: right
- Other object states unchanged: right
- Earlier assumption that pickup would not occur in this step was incorrect; in this execution, pickup did occur.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reason: The goal of retrieving the tomato from the table has already been achieved; tomato_3 is in the agent’s inventory. The planned actions (Move to table; Take tomato) are now unnecessary (and would be invalid since the tomato is no longer on the table).

Decision: Plan completed.

If you want, proceed with the next steps of the original task: move the tomato into the box, close the box, move the box into the chest, close the chest, and place the closed chest on the shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reason: The goal of retrieving the tomato from the table has already been achieved; tomato_3 is in the agent’s inventory. The planned actions (Move to table; Take tomato) are now unnecessary (and would be invalid since the tomato is no longer on the table).

Decision: Plan completed.

If you want, proceed with the next steps of the original task: move the tomato into the box, close the box, move the box into the chest, close the chest, and place the closed chest on the shelf.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] - Not sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The plan starts with taking the tomato from the table, but in the current state the tomato is already in the agent’s inventory. Executing that step would be redundant.
- The plan also omits any required movement actions to reach the box, chest, and shelf, which are necessary to perform the subsequent steps.

If you want, I can provide a minimal updated plan from the current state:
- Move to box_5 (3.0, 3.0)
- Put tomato_3 into box_5
- Close box_5
- Move to chest_6 (4.0, 1.0)
- Put box_5 into chest_6
- Close chest_6
- Move to shelf_7 (2.0, 1.0)
- Place chest_6 on shelf_7

This revised plan reflects the actual state and includes necessary navigation.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here is a concise refinement of the current plan, pruning the completed portion and decomposing the remaining steps into concrete sub-actions.

Pruned and refined plan:

- Prune completed step:
  - Remove: “First take the tomato from the table.” Tomato_3 is already in inventory.

- Step 2 (insert tomato into box and close box):
  - 2.1 Move to box_5 at (3.0, 3.0)
  - 2.2 Put tomato_3 into box_5
  - 2.3 Close box_5

- Step 3 (move box into chest and close chest):
  - 3.1 Move to chest_6 at (4.0, 1.0)
  - 3.2 Put box_5 into chest_6
  - 3.3 Close chest_6

- Step 4 (place closed chest on shelf):
  - 4.1 Move to shelf_7 at (2.0, 1.0)
  - 4.2 Place chest_6 on shelf_7

Notes:
- Assumes tomato_3 remains in inventory until step 2.2.
- The plan preserves the required order: insert tomato, then box into chest, then chest onto shelf.
- No further pruning needed unless you want to consider parallel moves (not applicable here due to dependencies).

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. Reasoning:
- The plan is already a linear sequence of atomic actions (move, put, close, etc.) with explicit prerequisites.
- The current state satisfies the preconditions for the next actions: tomato_3 is in inventory, box_5 is at (3,3) and accessible, chest_6 is at (4,1) and ready to receive, and the agent is free to move toward box_5.
- There are no hidden subtasks or conditional branches required beyond the listed steps.

Proceed to execution starting with step [6]: Move to box_5 at (3.0, 3.0).

  - [6] 2.1 Move to box_5 at (3.0, 3.0)
  - [7] 2.2 Put tomato_3 into box_5
  - [8] 2.3 Close box_5
  - [9] 3.1 Move to chest_6 at (4.0, 1.0)

  - [11] 3.3 Close chest_6
  - [12] 4.1 Move to shelf_7 at (2.0, 1.0)
  - [13] 4.2 Place chest_6 on shelf_7

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Reasoning: Yes. Reasoning:
- The plan is already a linear sequence of atomic actions (move, put, close, etc.) with explicit prerequisites.
- The current state satisfies the preconditions for the next actions: tomato_3 is in inventory, box_5 is at (3,3) and accessible, chest_6 is at (4,1) and ready to receive, and the agent is free to move toward box_5.
- There are no hidden subtasks or conditional branches required beyond the listed steps.

Proceed to execution starting with step [6]: Move to box_5 at (3.0, 3.0).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (1.0,4.0) to (3.0,3.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of action:
- Moved from (1.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 3.0); no pickup/drop occurred. Inventory remains [tomato_3].

Current facts:
- Agent at (3.0, 3.0); inventory [tomato_3]
- tomato_3 in inventory; not on table_4
- table_4 contents_count = 0; contents = []
- box_5 open at (3.0, 3.0); empty
- chest_6 open at (4.0, 1.0); empty
- cabinet_8 closed/unlocked at (0.5, 1.5)
- shelf_7 empty
- bin_9 empty
- potatocarrot_10 at (4.5, 0.5)

Assumptions about the new state:
- Move would succeed: holds (true)
- No pickup/drop during this move: holds (false for pickup, since not applicable here)
- Other objects unchanged: holds

Which assumptions proved right or wrong?
- Right: Move succeeded; tomato remained in inventory; other objects unchanged.
- Wrong: Any assumption that a pickup would occur in this move is not applicable here (no pickup happened in this action).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.

Reasoning: The overall plan requires multiple actions beyond moving to box_5. So far you have only moved to the box. The tomato is in your inventory but has not yet been placed into the box, the box has not been closed, the box hasn’t been moved into the chest, the chest hasn’t been closed, and the closed chest hasn’t been placed on the shelf.

Current state recap (brief):
- Agent at (3.0, 3.0); inventory: [tomato_3]
- tomato_3 in inventory; not on table
- box_5 open at (3.0, 3.0); empty
- chest_6 open at (4.0, 1.0); empty
- cabinet_8 closed/unlocked
- shelf_7 empty
- potatocarrot_10 at (4.5, 0.5)

Next minimal actions to continue the plan:
- Put tomato_3 into box_5 and close box_5
- Put box_5 into chest_6 and close chest_6
- Place the closed chest on shelf_7

If you want, I can outline the exact next action sequence.

- Put box_5 into chest_6 and close chest_6
- Place the closed chest on shelf_7

If you want, I can outline the exact next action sequence.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You are already at box_5 (3.0, 3.0). Moving there again would not change the state and would not advance the goal. Progress requires interacting with the box (putting the tomato in and closing the box) and then continuing the plan from the chest to the shelf.

Answer: No.

Recommended next actions (minimal, goal-directed sequence):
- Drop tomato_3 into box_5 (at 3.0, 3.0)
- Close box_5
- Move to chest_6 (4.0, 1.0)
- Put box_5 into chest_6
- Close chest_6
- Move to shelf_7 (2.0, 1.0)
- Place chest_6 on shelf_7

Goal: A tomato lies on the table. A box, a chest and a shelf are in the room. First take the tomato from the table. Then put the tomato into the box and close the box. After that put the box into the chest and close the chest. Finally, place the closed chest on the shelf.
Current plan tree:
- [14] A tomato lies on the table. A box, a chest and a shelf are in the room. First take the tomato from the table. Then put the tomato into the box and close the box. After that put the box into the chest and close the chest. Finally, place the closed chest on the shelf. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
