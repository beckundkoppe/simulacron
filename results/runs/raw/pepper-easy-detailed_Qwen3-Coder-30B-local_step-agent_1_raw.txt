[observer] I observe 3 peppers in the room:
- pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5)
- pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5) 
- pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0)

I also see a table_6 at (3.5, 0.5) that is currently empty.

All peppers are located near the table area, with pepper_3 and pepper_5 positioned directly adjacent to the table.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Take pepper_3.
