[observer] I observe a key at position (3.0,1.0) and a table at position (0.0,3.0) that is currently empty. 

The key is relevant because it could be used to unlock the door (which is currently unlocked but might be locked), and the table is where I need to place the potato once I find it.

I don't see any potato in the current room. I need to go to the other room to find it. The door at (4.0,4.0) leads to the other room.

[reflector] **Effects of actions:**
- Moved from (0.0,0.0) to (4.0,4.0) 
- Went through door_6 into chamber

**Facts:**
- Successfully entered the other room through the door
- The door was accessible (unlocked or could be opened)

**Assumptions verified:**
- The door led to the other room (correct)
- The other room contains the potato (to be confirmed)

**Assumptions that need verification:**
- The potato exists in this room (not yet confirmed)
- The table in this room is the target location (not yet confirmed)

The action successfully moved me to the other room, but I haven't yet found the potato or confirmed the table is the correct target location.

The chest on the shelf is now empty, which means the potato was retrieved from it in the previous step. The diamond in the box is unrelated to the current goal.
