[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- The carrot is now on the table at (1.0, 4.0).  
- The table is no longer empty.  
- The human is no longer holding the carrot (the carrot is now on the table).  

**Assumptions made**

1. The table at (1.0, 4.0) was empty – **proved right**.  
2. The carrot was reachable and could be picked up – **proved right**.  
3. The human could move to the table and place the carrot – **proved right**.  

All assumptions held true; the state now reflects the carrot sitting on the table.
