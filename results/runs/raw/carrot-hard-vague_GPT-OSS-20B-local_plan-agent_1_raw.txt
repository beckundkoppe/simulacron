[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Fact | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Carrot on table** | The carrot is now resting on the surface of the table. |
| **Human at table** | The human moved to the table’s location before placing the carrot. |
| **Carrot was in inventory** | The human had the carrot in hand (or inventory) prior to placing it. |
| **Table is reachable** | The table was within the human’s movement range. |
| **Table has a surface** | The table can hold objects. |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The table is within reach of the human.  
2. The table has a flat surface capable of holding the carrot.  
3. The carrot was in the human’s inventory before the action.  
4. No other objects obstruct the placement (e.g., no other item on the table).  

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong**

- **All assumptions proved correct.**  
  - The table was reachable and had a surface.  
  - The carrot was indeed in the human’s inventory.  
  - No obstacles prevented placement.  

No new discoveries were made; the state change is fully accounted for by the facts above.
