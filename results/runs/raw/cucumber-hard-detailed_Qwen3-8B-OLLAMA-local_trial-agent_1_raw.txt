Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [312] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal requires breaking down into specific actions like locating the cucumber (e.g., searching rooms, checking shelves), interacting with it (e.g., picking it up), and moving it to the table. A single-node plan lacks the granularity needed for execution. 

**Answer:** No, the plan needs decomposition into actionable steps (e.g., "search room A," "pick up cucumber," "move to table").

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan:**  
1. **Find the cucumber** (search the room, check common locations like the fridge, countertop, or fruit bowl).  
2. **Pick up the cucumber** (move to its location and interact with it).  
3. **Place the cucumber on the table** (navigate to the table and drop it).  

This decomposition ensures minimal steps while maintaining clarity and actionability. No pruning needed; the plan is straightforward.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed for execution. Each goal (find, pick up, place) is broken into actionable subtasks with clear, minimal steps. The search locations for the cucumber are specific, and the actions (move, interact, drop) align with the environment's capabilities. No redundant steps are included, making it ready for execution. 

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is decomposed adequately to begin execution.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to cucumber_3's location (3.5,1.5) and collected it.  

**Facts:**  
- Cucumber_3 is now in the agent's inventory.  
- The table (table_4) is at (3.5,0.5), directly below the cucumber's position.  

**Assumptions:**  
- No obstacles block movement from (3.5,1.5) to (3.5,0.5).  
- The table is accessible and can accept the cucumber.  

**Validation:**  
- Assumption about obstacle-free path is **correct** (no obstacles detected).  
- Assumption about table functionality is **untested**, but likely valid given the environment description.  

**Next Step:** Move to table_4's location and place the cucumber.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising. The agent has already located and picked up the cucumber, and the next step (moving to the table and placing the cucumber) is directly achievable with no obstacles. The earlier search phase is completed, and the current actions align with the goal. No redundant or unproductive steps are being repeated. 

**Answer:** Yes.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The plan is still promising. The agent has already located and picked up the cucumber, and the next step (moving to the table and placing the cucumber) is directly achievable with no obstacles. The earlier search phase is completed, and the current actions align with the goal. No redundant or unproductive steps are being repeated. 

**Answer:** Yes.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to table_4's location (3.5,0.5) to place the cucumber.

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 2.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 3.5, "y": 1.5}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "cucumber", "id": "cucumber_3"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "chest", "description": "A wooden chest.", "id": "chest_5", "position": "(2.0,2.0)", "state": "closed", "lock_state": "unlocked", "contents_count": "empty", "contents": ["unknown"]}, {"name": "table", "description": "A sturdy oak table with carved legs and a few burn marks from candles.", "id": "table_4", "position": "(3.5,0.5)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "potato", "id": "potato_6", "position": "(0.5,1.5)"}]} Reasoning: Move to table_4's location (3.5,0.5) to place the cucumber. Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
