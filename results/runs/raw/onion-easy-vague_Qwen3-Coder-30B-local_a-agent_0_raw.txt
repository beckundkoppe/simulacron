[observer] I observe an onion on a table in the living room. The onion is at position (3, 3.25) on the table. 

Relevant for goal: The onion is the only item that needs to be moved to the compost outside. The door to the outside (door_15) is closed but unlocked, which is needed to exit the room to reach the compost.

- Successfully reached door_15

**Facts:**
- Agent is now at door_15 position (0.0, 1.75)

- Door_15 is open and leads outside to compost

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Door_15 is the correct exit door to compost
- Door_15 is open and accessible
- Can move through hallway to reach door

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- Initially thought I could interact with door from (0.0, 5.5) - needed to move closer first

**Next step:** Go through door_15 to reach compost outside.

[reflector] **Effect of action:** Went through door_15 into living_room

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in living_room (not outside as expected)
- Onion is still in inventory
- Door_15 is open and accessible

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- Assumed door_15 leads outside to compost area
- Assumed going through door_15 would take agent outside

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Door_15 can be opened and used as exit
- Door_15 is accessible from current position

**Problem:** The door leads back into the living_room instead of outside, meaning the compost location is not reachable through this door, or the door's destination is incorrectly mapped.

[observer] I observe that I am in the living room at position (4, 1.75). Door_15 is at position (4, 1.75) and is open and unlocked. The onion is in my inventory. 

The relevant observation is that door_15 is the exit door, but going through it just brings me back into the same living room (not outside to the compost).

[action_imaginator] Since door_15 leads back to the living room instead of outside, I need to find another exit door to reach the compost.

[observer] I observe that I am in the kitchen at position (3.5, 3). The onion is in my inventory. I see three doors:

[reflector] **Effects of actions:**
- Moved from hallway position (0, 4.5) to door_15 position (0, 1.75)
- Went through door_15 into living_room

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in living_room at position (4, 1.75)
- Onion is in inventory
- Door_15 is open and accessible
- Door_15 leads to compost area (but actually leads to living_room)

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Door_15 can be opened and used as exit
- Door_15 leads to compost area

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- Door_15 leads to compost outside (it leads to living_room)
- Compost is reachable through door_15 (it's not the correct exit)

**Problem:** Still haven't reached compost outside. The correct exit door remains unidentified.

[reflector] **Effect of action:** Went through door_19 into mudroom

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in mudroom
- Onion is in inventory
- Door_19 is open and accessible
- Door_19 leads to mudroom (not compost)

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- Door_19 leads to compost area (it leads to mudroom)
- Door_19 leads to actual compost area outside (it leads to mudroom)

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Door_19 can be opened and used as exit
- Can move between rooms through doors

**Conclusion:** The correct exit door remains unidentified. All currently accessible doors lead to rooms that don't contain the compost area.

Relevant for goal: Door_20 at (2, 1) is the only other door in this room that I haven't checked yet, and it's closed but unlocked. This could potentially lead to the compost area, unlike the doors I've already tried which led to the hallway and mudroom.

[reflector] **Effect of action:** Moved from garden position (0, 6) to compost area position (0.5, 4.25)

**Facts:**
- Agent is now at compost area position (0.5, 4.25)
- Compost area exists and is currently empty
- Onion is in inventory

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Compost area exists in garden
- Can move between locations in garden

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- Door_20 leads directly to compost area (it leads to garden, not directly to compost)
- Compost area was already found through door_20 (it was discovered during movement, not through the door)
