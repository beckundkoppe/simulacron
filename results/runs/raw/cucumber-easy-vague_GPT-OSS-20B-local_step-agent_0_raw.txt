[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human position | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber position | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table position | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table contents | empty |
| Cucumber on table | **No** |

**Assumptions made and their validity**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Human moved from (0,0) to (3.5,1.5) | **Correct** – the human is now at the cucumber. |
| Cucumber remained at (3.5,1.5) | **Correct** – no pick‑up or placement occurred. |
| Table remained empty | **Correct** – nothing was placed on it. |
| Cucumber is not on the table | **Correct** – the goal “place cucumber on table” has not yet been achieved. |

**Summary**

The single action moved the human to the cucumber’s location but did not pick up or place the cucumber. All state assumptions hold true, but the overall goal of placing the cucumber on the table remains unmet. The next minimal actions would be: pick up cucumber, move to table, place cucumber.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human position | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber position | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table position | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table contents | empty |
| Cucumber on table | No |

**Assumptions made**

1. Human moved correctly from (0,0) to (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Cucumber stayed at (3.5, 1.5) (no pick‑up).  
3. Table remained empty.  
4. Cucumber is not on the table.

**Which assumptions held?**

- Assumptions 1–4 are all **correct** given the state snapshot.  
- The reported “Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3” is inconsistent with the fact that the cucumber is still at (3.5, 1.5); that assumption would be **wrong** if it were intended to mean the cucumber was picked up.

**Next minimal steps to achieve the goal**

1. Pick up cucumber.  
2. Move to the table (3.5, 0.5).  
3. Place cucumber on the table.

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber remained in the human’s inventory (no drop).  
2. The table stayed empty (nothing was placed on it).  
3. The cucumber is not on the table.

**Assumptions that held**

All three assumptions are correct given the state snapshot. The goal “place cucumber on table” is still unmet; the next minimal steps are to place the cucumber on the table.
