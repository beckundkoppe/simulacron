Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**  
- The human is now at the location of **pepper_5** (3.5, 1.0).  
- No object has been picked up or moved yet; the pepper remains where it was.  
- The table (table_6) is still empty at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Assumptions made before the move**  
1. *“Moving to pepper_5 will place me close enough to pick it up.”* – Correct; the agent is now exactly on the pepper’s coordinates, which is the required proximity for a pick‑up action.  
2. *“The move will not affect any other objects or the table.”* – Correct; the only change is the agent’s position.  

**Assumptions that could be wrong (but not yet tested)**  
- That the pepper is free to be taken (e.g., not locked in a container). This will be verified when attempting to pick it up.  
- That the table remains empty after later actions; we’ll need to ensure we place all peppers there.

3. *Moving does not affect other objects* – pepper 4, pepper 3, and the table are unchanged.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

- Human is at (3.5, 1.0) with an empty inventory.  
- **pepper_5** is now on **table_6** (location (3.5, 0.5)).  
- **pepper_4** remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
- **pepper_3** remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **table_6** is no longer empty; it holds pepper_5.

**Assumptions about the new state**

- The drop action can be performed from the human’s current position (i.e., proximity to the table is sufficient).  
- The table can accept and store objects placed on it.  
- Once dropped, the pepper is no longer “held” by the human.  

**Assumptions verified**

- The drop succeeded, confirming that proximity was adequate.  
- The table accepted the pepper, showing it can hold items.  
- Pepper_5 is now on the table and not in the inventory, confirming the transfer of ownership.

No assumptions were disproved.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (pick‑up of pepper_3)**  

- **Human** is at **(3.5, 1.5)**.  
- **Inventory** now contains **pepper_3** (the pepper is “held”).  
- **pepper_3** is no longer located at (3.5, 1.5); its location is now *held*.  
- **pepper_5** remains on **table_6** at **(3.5, 0.5)**.  
- **pepper_4** is still at **(3.0, 1.5)**.  
- **table_6** is unchanged (still at (3.5, 0.5)) and continues to hold **pepper_5**.  

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. *The pepper is free to be taken* – i.e., not locked inside another object.  
2. *Being on the same coordinates as the pepper is sufficient proximity for a pick‑up.*  
3. *The human can hold at least one object (no inventory limit reached).*  

**Assumptions verified**

- **Assumption 1** proved correct: the pick‑up succeeded, so pepper 3 was not obstructed.  
- **Assumption 2** proved correct: being exactly at (3.5, 1.5) allowed the action.  
- **Assumption 3** proved correct: the human now holds pepper 3 without issue.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move (3.5, 1.5) → (3.5, 0.5))**

- Human is now at **(3.5, 0.5)**.
- Inventory still contains **pepper_3** (held).
- **pepper_5** remains on **table_6** at **(3.5, 0.5)**.
- **pepper_4** is unchanged at **(3.0, 1.5)**.
- **table_6** is still at **(3.5, 0.5)** and continues to hold **pepper_5**.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. Moving to the table’s coordinates puts the human close enough to interact with the table (e.g., to drop the held pepper).  
2. The move does not affect the positions of any other objects.  
3. Holding a pepper does not prevent the human from standing on the same tile as the table.

**Verification**

- **Assumption 1:** Still untested (drop not yet performed), but proximity is sufficient for future interaction.  
- **Assumption 2:** Confirmed – **pepper_4** and **pepper_5** stayed where they were.  
- **Assumption 3:** Confirmed – the human stands on the table’s tile while still holding **pepper_3**.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (move (3.5, 0.5) → (3, 1.5))**

**Facts after the move**
- Human is now at **(3, 1.5)**.  
- Inventory is empty.  
- **table_6** remains at (3.5, 0.5) holding **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- **pepper_4** is still at **(3, 1.5)** (the same tile the human now occupies).  
- No other objects changed position.

**Assumptions about the new state**
1. Moving does not relocate any other objects.  
2. Being on the same coordinates as an object gives the required proximity to pick it up.  
3. The move itself is always possible (no obstacles in the path).

**Verification**
- **Assumption 1** – confirmed: table, pepper 5, pepper 3, and pepper 4 stayed where they were.  
- **Assumption 2** – now true: the human is exactly on pepper 4’s tile, so a pick‑up can be performed.  
- **Assumption 3** – confirmed: the move succeeded without error.

No assumptions were disproved. The only change is the human’s location; all peppers are now either on the table (pepper 5, pepper 3) or ready to be collected (pepper 4 at the human’s new position).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (pick‑up of pepper_4)**  
- Human is at **(3.0, 1.5)**.  
- Inventory now contains **pepper_4** (the pepper is “held”).  
- **pepper_4** is no longer at (3.0, 1.5).  
- **table_6** remains at **(3.5, 0.5)** and still holds **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- No other objects moved or changed.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. *pepper_4 was free to be taken* (not inside a container or locked).  
2. *Being exactly on the pepper’s coordinates is sufficient proximity to pick it up.*  
3. *The human can hold at least one object, even while standing on a tile that also contains other objects (the table).*

**Verification**  
- Assumption 1: **proved right** – the pick‑up succeeded, so pepper 4 was accessible.  
- Assumption 2: **proved right** – exact co‑location allowed the pick‑up.  
- Assumption 3: **proved right** – inventory now holds pepper 4 without issue.  

All assumptions held; the goal is now one step away (placing pepper 4 on the table).

[reflector] **Facts after the last move (3.0, 1.5 → 3.5, 0.5)**  

- Human is at **(3.5, 0.5)** – the same tile as **table_6**.  
- Inventory holds **pepper_4** (still “held”).  
- **table_6** (at 3.5, 0.5) continues to hold **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- No other objects changed position.

**Assumptions about the new state**  

1. Moving onto the table’s tile is allowed and does not cause a collision.  
2. The move does not relocate any other objects (table, peppers already on it).  
3. Being on the same tile as the table gives the required proximity to later **drop** the held pepper.  
4. The table can accept additional items beyond the two already on it.

**Assumptions verified / disproved**  

- **1 – proved right:** the move succeeded, so standing on the table tile is permitted.  
- **2 – proved right:** pepper_5, pepper_3, and the table stayed where they were.  
- **3 – not yet tested:** dropping has not been performed, so proximity remains assumed but unconfirmed.  
- **4 – not yet tested:** we have not yet dropped pepper_4, so the table’s capacity for a third item is still assumed.
