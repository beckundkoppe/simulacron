[action_imaginator] Go to the cucumber position

content='So the final action plan\'s tool calls are:\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcalls": [\n    {\n      "function": "move_to_object",\n      "arguments": {\n        "object_id": "cucumber_3"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, let me double check: does move_to_object require you to be nearby the object or can it work from anywhere? The problem doesn\'t specify. Given that move_to_position is available and doesn\'t have such constraints (assuming), but since we start at origin and are moving within room bounds, both should work. But if move_to_object requires proximity, then we\'d need first to go close but the description says "the human moves to a position", not necessarily nearby.\n\nWait looking back at function descriptions:\n"move_to_position": just needs x,y coordinates. No constraints mentioned.\n"move_to_object": description matches "move_to_position" (typo perhaps? Original has same desc for both 1st two functions, likely copy-paste error in problem statement)\n\nAssuming that\'s a typo and move_to_object is like move to object\'s location by ID with same movement logic.\n\nGiven that, and task says go to position not interact/do with object, both methods valid but as discussed move_to_position more precise for wording "go to position".\n\nBut likely the problem expects us to use move_to_object since it\'s about moving towards an object\'s position.\n\nAlternatively perhaps move_to_position is for arbitrary coords, move_to_object is shortcut when you know object_id corresponding to target location.\n\nGiven ambiguity in which to prefer, and since we\'re to follow planned action: "go to cucumber position", and both actions would achieve that, but one is more direct in specifying the position coordinates explicitly.\n\nBut in absence of other instructions, and to match more general programming intent where functions abstract lower details, likely move_to_object is preferred here since it\'s moving to an object\'s location by its id.\n\nFinal decision: use move_to_object as it directly addresses the intent without dealing with explicit coordinates which might change but object\'s id association with position can be managed internally by system based on current perception data.\n\nThus final tool call:\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcalls": [\n    {\n      "function": "move_to_object",\n      "arguments": {\n        "object_id": "cucumber_3"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, looking back at the very beginning of problem statement, it says:\n "The human moves to a position." for both `move_to_position` and `move_to_object`. This suggests that move_to_object\'s description might be incorrectly copied over from move_to_position. Perhaps move_to_object is intended to work by specifying the object_id only without needing to know its position.\n\nBut in our actual perception data, we have the cucumber at (3.5,1.5), and if system can look up object positions internally using IDs then it\'s equivalent.\n\nGiven that likely both are correct, but since task is "go to cucumber position", it\'s about the position of cucumber which can be accessed by its id or coordinates directly here since we have them in perception.\n\nBut more likely intended use is via object_id when available (like in this problem) so probably expects move_to_object with object_id="cucumber_3".\n\nThus final answer:\n\n```json\n{"toolcalls": [{"function": "move_to_object", "arguments": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\{"toolcalls": [\\{\\"function\\": \\"move\\_to\\_object\\", \\"arguments\\": \\{"object\\_id\\": \\"cucumber\\_3\\"\\}]\\}}' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2303, 'prompt_tokens': 1111, 'total_tokens': 3414, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-33', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0267-e4ab-7692-9e6f-1ff1641e648e-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1111, 'output_tokens': 2303, 'total_tokens': 3414, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='Based on the reasoning and constraints you\'ve provided, I\'ll draft my approach to this task:\n\n1.

After picking up the cucumber, my next action should be placing it onto the table at a specific position (3.5, 0.8) within the given room dimensions ensuring it doesn\'t overlap with any existing objects and stays within bounds.

which implies the sequence of function names with their arguments as they would be passed to an API, here\'s the exact required output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"take_from": {"what_id": "cucumber_3", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, without being able to render proper JSON interactively here (and given the original problem\'s phrasing expects a textual sequence rather than programmatic data structures), the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Sequence of actions:**\n1. move_to_position(x="3.5", y="1.5")\n2. take_from(what_id="cucumber_3", from_id="FLOOR")\n\nBut since \'tool calls\' might mean the function names themselves with their arguments, here\'s the cleanest representation without additional formatting:\n\n```\nmove_to_position x="3.5" y="1.5"\ntake_from what_id="cucumber_3" from_id="FLOOR"\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n    {"action": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"action": "take_from", "parameters": {"what_id": "cucumber_3", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, considering the original problem\'s phrasing and typical expectations for such tasks (like generating a sequence of function calls), here is the most straightforward textual representation:\n\n```\nmove_to_position x="3.5" y="1.5"\ntake_from from_id="FLOOR" what_id="cucumber_3"\n```\n\nBut to align with common API representations where parameters are Key: value pairs, and assuming JSON-like expectations despite being in text form, here\'s the final formulation:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"take_from": {"what_id": "cucumber_3", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n]\n```\n\nBut if the above isn\'t renderable in this context (as it might require code marking), then the answer is simply:\n\nUse these two actions in order:\n1. move_to_position with parameters x="3.5" and y="1.5"\n2. take_from with parameters what_id="cucumber_3" and from_id="FLOOR"\n\nExpressed as a sequence without extra markup.\n\nGiven those considerations, here\'s the most unambiguous textual answer:\n\n```\nmove_to_position(x="3.5", y="1.5"), then take_from(what_id="cucumber_3", from_id="FLOOR")\n```\n\nBut to strictly follow common API call documentation styles where parameters are listed with their names aligned (for clarity when many params exist), and considering that in actual code or JSON representations, the order and parentheses matter:\n\nFor maximum clarity and adherence to typical usage format (though without code block support here), the sequence is represented as follows:\n\nFirst action: `move_to_position`\nParameters:\n- x="3.5"\n- y="1.5"\n\nSecond action: `take_from`\nParameters:\n- what_id="cucumber_3"\n- from_id="FLOOR"\n\nThus, the complete ordered sequence of tool calls with their parameters is as initially detailed above.\n\n**Final Simplified Answer:**\n\n```\nmove_to_position x=3.5 y=1.5\ntake_from from_id=FLOOR what_id=cucumber_3\n```\n\nThis assumes that:\n- Tool calls are named without spaces before parentheses when in invocation context (though some APIs may differ).\n- Parameter passing uses `key=value` notation for clarity, matching how many systems represent function arguments, especially in textual descriptions outside of full code blocks.\n\nThus, this is the most readable and unambiguous representation given the constraints.\n\nHowever, if we must strictly match functional call syntax where parameters would be in parentheses (but without actual code execution context), it might look like:\n\n`move_to_position("3.5", "1.5")`\n`take_from("cucumber_3", "FLOOR")`\n\nBut this is less clear due to missing parameter names, which are crucial for correct usage when there are multiple parameters of the same type (e.g., all strings or numbers).\n\nGiven that both `x` and `y` in the first call and `what_id`/`from_id` in the second expect string parameters in our case (as values are in quotes), omitting names is error-prone.\n\nTherefore, the most robust representation is to explicitly pair parameter names with their values as shown earlier, without relying purely on positional order which isn\'t always clear from problem statements.\n\nHence, retaining parameter names with their values in each function call forms the definitively correct answer regardless of specific syntax expectations between different languages or specifications.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "action": "move_to_position",\n        "params": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}\n    },\n    {\n        "action": "take_from",\n        "params": {"what_id": "cucumber_3", "from_id": "FLOOR"}\n    }\n]\n```\n\nBut since we\'re not in a JSON environment here, and to present it purely as the sequence of tool calls with named parameters (as would be required by their definitions), here\'s the definitive textual representation:\n\nThe correct sequence is:\n\n1. `move_to_position` with parameters:\n   - `x="3.5"`\n   - `y="1.5"`\n2. `take_from` with parameters:\n   - `what_id="cucumber_3"`\n   - `from_id="FLOOR"`\n\nThis ensures full clarity and avoids any ambiguity in parameter order or type expectations.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```\nmove_to_position(x: 3.5, y: 1.5)\ntake_from(what_id: "cucumber_3", from_id: "FLOOR")\n```\n\nOr with equals signs for traditional assignment-style:\n\n```plaintext\nmove_to_position x=3.5 y=1.5\ntake_from what_id=cucumber_3 from_id=FLOOR\n```\n\nBut considering that in many systems, string arguments require quotes, and numeric ones do not, while here both coordinates are given as floats (3.5) which might or may not be quoted in the actual function\'s parameter parsing - though all non-numeric parameters like IDs would need quotes to avoid being mistaken for variables.\n\nGiven that in perception data, "cucumber_3" is presented with quotes, and positions\' numbers might be passed as strings if the API expects them that way (or as floats/integers directly). But since no type info is provided about what the function parameters expect, it\'s safer to quote everything unless we know certain params definitely take non-string types (like integers or booleans).\n\nThus, quoting all parameter values:\n\n```plaintext\nmove_to_position x="3.5" y="1.5"\ntake_from what_id="cucumber_3" from_id="FLOOR"\n```\n\nAnd this aligns with the initial representation where x and y were quoted as they appeared in the JSON perception data.\n\n**Therefore, the definitive correct sequence of tool calls is:**\n\n```plaintext\nmove_to_position(x="3.5", y="1.5")\ntake_from(what_id="cucumber_3", from_id="FLOOR")\n```\n\n*(Formatting with parentheses or line breaks may vary without affecting meaning, but named parameters with values in quotes are essential for correctness.)*' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 5054, 'prompt_tokens': 1124, 'total_tokens': 6178, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-671', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b026f-002f-7000-b179-98bc4d00e3e7-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1124, 'output_tokens': 5054, 'total_tokens': 6178, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

[action_imaginator] move to cucumber

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
            

content='```json\n[{"move_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nWait, looking back at tool definitions:\n\nThe function is `move_to_position` and `move_to_object`. I miswrote it as move_object earlier. Correcting that:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nBut wait again - the first parameter in my initial thought was incorrect. The correct spelling should be move_to_object, not move_object.\n\nHowever, reviewing function descriptions carefully:\n\n**`move_to_position`** is for moving to coordinates (x,y).\n**`move_to_object`** description says "The human moves to a position" with parameters object_id.\n\nWait that seems contradictory - the description of `move_to_object` mentions moving to a position but expects an object_id as parameter, not x,y. That might be a mislabeling in definitions.\n\nBut likely, `move_to_object`\'s actual purpose is moving toward an object specified by its id. So given "cucumber_3" is the target\'s id and its location is (3.5,1.5), calling move_to_object with id "cucumber_3" would achieve the goal of getting near that object.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nWait now I\'m seeing that initially in first thought process, there was confusion between two similar named functions. But reviewing again original tools provided are:\n\n1) move_to_position: requires x,y position\n2) move_to_object: requires object_id.\n\nSo to move towards cucumber, since we have its object_id ("cucumber_3"), we\'d use `move_to_object` with that id as argument, and the system would presumably calculate or know how to get there based on its positioned at (3.5,1.5) in this room context without needing us to specify coordinates.\n\nThus final toolcall is:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nBut just to ensure, the description says for move_to_position: "The human moves to a position." and takes x,y.\nWhereas move_to_object:also says "the human moves to a position" but takes an object_id parameter instead. Maybe it\'s mislabeled and actually moves you relative to that object (e.g., turns facing), but seems intended to handle the movement to where \'object_id\' is located.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, safer might be to use move_to_position with x,y from cucumber\'s location in this case since it\'s explicitly given we know its position coordinates.\n\nBut task says "Use correct object id", suggesting when possible prefer functions accepting ids over raw positions. So likely `move_to_object` is intended for this case where target is identified by an object instance like cucumber_3 rather than arbitrary coordinates.\n\nThus sticking with `move_to_object` seems intended based on instructions to use correct object id when applicable, as it\'s more semantic and likely encapsulated position logic internally.\n\nTherefore final answer is single json array with one toolcall: move_to_object for cucumber_3.\n\nBut wait original input shows table_4 at same x,y as human\'s initial pos (3.5,0.5). This suggests perhaps positions represent centers or regions rather than hard collisions since two entities can\'t truly occupy exact same coordinate unless it\'s a shared position in some abstract sense.\n\nAssuming typical physics where objects occupy space would mean initial setup is impossible - no way for human to be at(3.5,0.5) if table is also there. Thus positions likely represent regions or centers and co-existence implies non-blocking overlap. Then moving to cucumber\'s position(3.5,1.5) changes y-coordinate only; no need worry about passing through/around table on floor which is also at (3.5,0.5).\n\nBut since using `move_to_object` abstracts away path details entirely, and instruction says use correct object_id when available (which we have as "cucumber_3"), that\'s most correct approach.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nHowever to confirm let me re-examine original instructions about toolcall generation and task in this prompt. Earlier I may have misparsed the input\'s structure due to formatting. The full input is one line with a dictionary followed by a space then "Reasoning: {imagination} Task:" etc.\n\nWait likely intended format was these as separate lines but merged during transmission here. So original problem input is:\n\n```\n{"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", ... },\n "your_inventory": [],\n "your_perception": [...]}\nReasoning: move to cucumber\nTask:\nGive exactly the toolcalls ...\n```\n\nThus main data is in the dictionary, and following text specifies reasoning instruction and then task requirements.\n\nGiven that our planned action based on "move to cucumber" reasoning is generate toolcalls achieving that movement using appropriate function with correct object id (cucumber_3), and no other actions needed (no take/put/drop needed since it\'s just moving there).\n\nThus final output is:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nBut double-checking if initial position near table affects: human starts at same spot as table but table has empty contents and no interactive elements are mentioned - seems irrelevant to movement action. Cucumber is separate object at different coordinates (same x, higher y).\n\nNo locks/keys or other constraints visible in this scenario.\n\nThus single toolcall suffices.\n\nWait one last check: is the move_to_position or move_to_object function more appropriate here? Given that we have both position coordinates and an object ID for cucumber, which to pick?\n\nThe instruction says "Use correct object id", suggesting preference when available over raw positions. So move_to_object is likely intended usecase despite both being possible.\n\nThus stick with that choice unless system expects us to manually position (which seems against use-object-id instruction).\n\nTherefore concluding:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}]\n```\n\nBut wait seeing original tool definitions carefully: move_to_object description in code comment says "The human moves to a position.", not "to the object\'s position", with parameter object_id suggesting moving relative to an object - but not clearly. Alternatively might be misworded and should say moves towards where that object is positioned.\n\nGiven ambiguity better rely on parameter types: \'move_to_position\' takes x,y; move_to_object takes object_id. Since task specifies use correct object id when possible, and we have one for target (cucumber_3), thus should use latter function even if description\'s wording is slightly confusing. Parameter name being object_id strongly suggests it moves relative to that target item\'s location.\n\nThus final correct answer is as JSON array above.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2986, 'prompt_tokens': 1109, 'total_tokens': 4095, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-651', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0271-c030-7351-b47c-1ec2f0745e38-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1109, 'output_tokens': 2986, 'total_tokens': 4095, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='To solve this task, I need to determine the appropriate sequence of tool calls required to interact with objects in a room based on their positions and contents. The user is starting at position (3.5, 0.5) and wants to pick up a cucumber located at (3.5, 1.5).\n\nFirst, the user needs to move towards the cucumber. Since they are currently at position (3.5, 0.5), they need to move north by 1 unit in the y-direction to reach position (3.5, 2.0). However, there is no object mentioned at this exact new position, so I assume it\'s a misposition and the cucumber is actually at (3.5, 1.5).\n\nAfter confirming this, I need to ensure that the user moves to the correct position of the cucumber at (3.5, 1.5).\n\nFinally, once near or at the object containing the item, the tool call for taking the item from the current location should be used.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. Move to position where the cucumber is located.\n2. Pick the cucumber.\n\nTool calls that arise from this planned action:\n\n```python\n{\n    "move_to_position": {\n        "x": 3.5,\n        "y": 1.5\n    }\n},\n{\n    "take_from": {\n        "from_id": "FLOOR",\n        "what_id": "cucumber_3"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo achieve the task, the appropriate sequence of tool calls is as follows:\n\n1.
