[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

| Object | Position | State |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) | not holding anything |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. **The cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5).**  
   *Proved right.* The cucumber’s location matches the given coordinates.

2. **Moving to the cucumber’s location would enable placing it on the table.**  
   *Proved wrong.* The action performed was only a move; no pick‑up or place action was executed, so the cucumber remains on the floor.

3. **The human is now positioned to perform the next step (pick‑up).**  
   *Proved right.* The human is at the cucumber’s location, ready for a pick‑up.

**Result**

The goal “Place the cucumber on the table” has not yet been achieved. The next minimal actions would be:  
1. `pick up cucumber`  
2. `move to (3.5, 0.5)`  
3. `place cucumber on table`.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved to the cucumber’s location and picked it up.  
- The cucumber is no longer on the floor; it is now held by the human.  
- The table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and still empty.  
- The human’s position is (3.5, 1.5) and is holding the cucumber.

**Facts after the action**

| Object   | Position | State          |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 1.5) | holding cucumber |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | in hand (not on floor) |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | empty          |

**Assumptions made**

1. **Cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5).** – *Proved right.*  
2. **Human is now holding the cucumber.** – *Proved right.*  
3. **Cucumber is no longer on the floor.** – *Proved right.*  
4. **Table remains empty.** – *Proved right.*

All assumptions about the new state are correct. The next minimal actions to achieve the goal are:  
1. `move to (3.5, 0.5)`  
2. `place cucumber on table`.
