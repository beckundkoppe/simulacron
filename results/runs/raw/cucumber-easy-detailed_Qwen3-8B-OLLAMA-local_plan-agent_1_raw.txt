Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.5,1.5)
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Agent is at (3.5, 1.5) with the cucumber collected.  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5), empty, and directly below the cucumber.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The agent can move vertically to the table (no obstacles).  
- The table accepts the cucumber as a valid placement.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- The table’s position aligns with the x-axis, confirming direct vertical movement.  
- The cucumber is now in the agent’s inventory, enabling placement.  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- The table’s capacity or rules (e.g., size, object restrictions) are not yet tested.  

**Next Step:** Move to (3.5, 0.5) and place the cucumber on the table.
