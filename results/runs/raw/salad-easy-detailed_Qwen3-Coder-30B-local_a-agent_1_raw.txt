- Spinach objects are at (1.0,1.0), (2.0,1.0), (3.0,1.0)
- Box_3 at (4.0,1.0) exists and is accessible
- Shelf_4 at (4.0,3.0) exists and is accessible

[observer] **Observations:**
- Currently at (4.0,3.0) in room "main"
- Inventory is empty
- Shelf_4 at (4.0,3.0) contains 2 lettuce items (lettuce_8, lettuce_9)
- Box_3 at (4.0,1.0) contains 3 spinach items (spinach_5, spinach_6, spinach_7)
- Lettuce_10 at (3.0,3.0) is new discovery

**Relevant for goal:** Need to collect lettuce_10 and move it to shelf_4. All spinach items are collected and stored in box_3.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,3.0) to (3.0,3.0)
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected lettuce_10
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**
- Moved from (4.0,3.0) to (3.0,3.0)
- Collected lettuce_10 into inventory

**Facts:**
- lettuce_10 is now in inventory
- Currently at (3.0,3.0)
- Shelf_4 contains lettuce_8 and lettuce_9
- Box_3 contains 3 spinach items

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Lettuce objects are at (1.0,3.0), (2.0,3.0), (3.0,3.0) - proved right
- Can collect objects from locations - proved right
- Shelf_4 exists and is accessible - proved right

**New state:** Currently at (3.0,3.0) with lettuce_10 in inventory, ready to move to shelf_4.
