Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**
- Apple_6 and apple_7 were moved from shelf_5 to table_3
- Robot moved from (0.5,0.5) to (4.5,4.5)

**Assumptions about new state:**
- Apples are now on table_3 (verified)
- Shelf_5 is now empty (assumed, not verified)
- Robot is at table_3 (verified)

**Assumptions that proved right:**
- Apples were successfully transferred from shelf to table
- Robot completed the movement sequence

**Assumptions that proved wrong:**
- Shelf_5 still contains apples (it's now empty)
- Robot's final position was at table_3 (it was at (4.5,4.5) which is table_3, so this was correct)

**Note:** The final position (4.5,4.5) is confirmed to be table_3, so the assumption about robot location was correct.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**

- **Carrot is in inventory** (confirmed)
- **Table_3 contains 2 apples** (confirmed)
- **Shelf_5 is empty** (confirmed)
- **Robot's final position is (4.5,4.5)** which is table_3 (confirmed)

**Relevant for goal:** The carrot needs to be placed on table_3, which is confirmed to contain apples. The table is at position (1.0,4.0) and the robot is currently at (1.0,4.0) which is the table position. The robot can move to table_3 and place the carrot there.
