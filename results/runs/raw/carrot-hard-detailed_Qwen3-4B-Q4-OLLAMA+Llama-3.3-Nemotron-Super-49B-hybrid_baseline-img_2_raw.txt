[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] **Next Action:** Move to the table

**Explicit Command:**
`move_to x=1.0 y=4.0`

*(This positions you at the table to set up for placing the carrot, assuming "on the table" implies on its surface and not necessarily requiring opening/closing an action first, which isn't mentioned as a requirement for this table object)*

---

**Follow-up Action (after moving):**
(To be executed after confirming the move is successful)
`drop_carrot id="carrot_4" onto_id="table_3"`

*(This will place the carrot on the table once you're in position. The system seems to require sequential actions for movement and then interaction)* 

Please respond with the outcome of `move_to x=1.0 y=4.0` to proceed with the follow-up action.

**Full Sequence for Clarity:**

1. **Move to Table**
   - Input: `move_to x=1.0 y=4.0`
   - Expected Output: Confirmation of new position at `(1.0, 4.0)`

2. **Place Carrot on Table (After Successful Move)**
   - Input: `drop_carrot id="carrot_4" onto_id="table_3"`
   - Expected Output: Confirmation carrot is placed on table_3, updating `contents_count` for table_3 to "contains 1 item"

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
