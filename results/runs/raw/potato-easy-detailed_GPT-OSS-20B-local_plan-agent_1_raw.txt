[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from the starting location \((0.0,0.0)\) to the location of **door_6** and passed through it, ending up in the adjacent room.

**Updated facts**

1. **Location** – The human is now in the room on the other side of door_6.  
2. **Door status** – Door_6 is traversable (it was open or unlocked).  
3. **Inventory** – Still empty (no objects have been picked up).  
4. **Room contents** – Unknown; we have not yet inspected the new room for the potato.

**Assumptions made and their validity**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Door_6 exists and connects to another room | The move succeeded, confirming the door’s existence and connectivity | **Correct** |
| The door is open/unlocked and can be passed through | The action succeeded without error | **Correct** |
| The new room contains the potato | Not yet verified; remains an open question | **Uncertain** |

**Next steps**

- Inspect the new room for the potato.  
- If found, pick it up and place it on the table.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- `open chest` had no effect (the chest could not be opened).

**Current facts**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human location | (0.0, 0.0) |
| Inventory | Empty |
| Shelf at (0.0, 0.0) | Contains a chest |
| Chest | Still closed (contains a potato) |
| Box at (0.0, 2.0) | Contains a diamond |
| Door at (0.0, 1.0) | Open/unlocked |

**Assumptions made**

1. The chest at (0.0, 0.0) holds a potato.  
2. The box at (0.0, 2.0) holds a diamond.  
3. The door at (0.0, 1.0) is open and unlocked.  
4. Opening the chest would succeed.

**Assumptions proved**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| Chest holds a potato | **Correct** |
| Box holds a diamond | **Correct** |
| Door is open/unlocked | **Correct** |
| Chest can be opened | **Wrong** (action failed) |

The only incorrect assumption was that the chest could be opened.

- Inventory: empty  
- Chest (0,0): closed, contains a potato  
- Box (0,2): contains a diamond  
- Key: on the floor at (3, 1)  
- Table (0,3): empty  
- Door (0,1): open/unlocked  
- Door (4,4): open/unlocked  

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Chest still contains the potato.  
2. Box still contains the diamond.  
3. Key remains on the floor at (3,1).  
4. Table remains empty.  
5. Doors at (0,1) and (4,4) remain open/unlocked.  
6. No new objects have appeared.

**Assumption outcomes**  
All six assumptions proved **correct**; none were contradicted by the action.

[user] 
Perception: {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 4.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 3.0, "y": 1.0}}, "your_inventory": [], "your_perception": [{"name": "key", "id": "key_4", "position": "(3.0,1.0)"}, {"name": "table", "id": "table_5", "position": "(0.0,3.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "door", "id": "door_6", "position": "(4.0,4.0)", "state": "open", "lock_state": "unlocked"}]}
What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - Key at your current location (3, 1).  
- Door at (4, 4) is open/unlocked.  
- Table at (0, 3) is empty.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] move to (0, 0)

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
