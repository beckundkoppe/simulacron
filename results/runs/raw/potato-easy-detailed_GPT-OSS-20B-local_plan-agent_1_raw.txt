1. The agent is now in the current room.

- A table exists in the current room.  
- The agent can move between rooms, pick up the potato, and place it on the table.

All of the above assumptions held true; no new objects or obstacles were discovered.

[reflector] **Effect of the action executed**

- The agent moved from (0.0, 0.0) to the closed‑but‑unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0) (door_6).  
- No objects were moved or interacted with.

**Current facts**

| Key | (3.0, 1.0) |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The potato remains in the other room.  
2. The agent can open the closed door (it is unlocked).  
3. The agent can move through the door into the other room.  
4. The agent can locate, pick up, and place the potato on the table.  

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Door is closed but unlocked.  
- Key is at (3.0, 1.0).  
- Table is empty.  
- Agent can move between rooms.

**Assumptions that proved wrong / remain unverified**

- The potato is not on the table (so it is still in the other room).  
- The agent has not yet found or interacted with the potato.

| Agent | (0.0, 0.0) on the shelf |
| Door_6 | (0.0, 1.0), open, unlocked |
| Key | (3.0, 1.0) |
| Chest (shelf) | (0.0, 0.0), contains the potato (unchanged) |
| Box | (0.0, 2.0), contains a diamond |
| Table | (0.0, 3.0), empty |

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. The chest can be opened.  
2. The potato inside the chest can be taken.  
3. The agent can then place the potato on the table.  
4. The table is within the same room and reachable.  
5. The door remains open and the agent can move freely inside the chamber.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- The chest still contains the potato.  
- The box still contains a diamond.  
- The door is open and unlocked.  
- The table is empty and exists at (0.0, 3.0).  

**Assumptions that proved wrong / remain unverified**

- The chest could not be opened with the attempted interaction → the chest is locked or otherwise inaccessible.  
- Consequently, the potato cannot be taken or placed on the table in this state.  
- The agent’s belief that the chest is openable was incorrect.  

The failure indicates that the chest is not interactable in the current configuration; the agent must find another way to access the potato (e.g., locate a key or unlock mechanism) before it can be moved to the table.

- The agent tried to open the chest at (0, 0).  
- The chest remained closed; the potato stayed inside.

| Item | Location / State |

| Door_6 | (0, 1), open, unlocked |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The chest can be opened.  
2. The potato inside can be taken.  
3. The agent can then place the potato on the table.  
4. The table is reachable within the same room.  
5. The door remains open, allowing free movement inside the chamber.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Chest still closed with the potato inside.  
- Box still holds the diamond.  
- Door remains open and unlocked.  
- Table exists at (0, 3) and is empty.  
- Key is at (3, 1).

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- The chest cannot be opened with the attempted interaction → it is locked or otherwise inaccessible.  
- Consequently, the potato cannot be moved to the table in this state.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- The attempt to open the chest on the shelf at (0, 0) failed; the chest remains closed and the potato stays inside.  
- No other objects or states changed.

**Current facts**  
- Agent: (0, 0) on the shelf.  
- Chest (shelf): closed, contains a potato.  
- Box (0, 2): contains a diamond.  
- Door (0, 1): open and unlocked.  
- Table (0, 3): empty.  
- Key: (3, 1).

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Chest is openable.  
2. Potato can be taken.  
3. Potato can be placed on the table.  
4. Table is reachable.  
5. Door remains open.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Door remains open and unlocked.  
- Key is at (3, 1).  
- Table exists at (0, 3) and is empty.  
- Box still holds the diamond.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- Chest cannot be opened (it is locked or otherwise inaccessible).  
- Therefore the potato cannot be taken or placed on the table.
