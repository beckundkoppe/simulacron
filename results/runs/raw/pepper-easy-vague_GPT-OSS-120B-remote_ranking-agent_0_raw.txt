[user] You are the execution policy of an agent in a dynamic graph.
You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Goal: Place all of the peppers on the table.

[user] You are the execution policy of an agent in a dynamic graph.
You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Goal: Place all of the peppers on the table.
Chosen action: interact_with_object table_6 open
Choice rationale: Ensures the table is in a usable state before dropping items, in case it requires opening.
