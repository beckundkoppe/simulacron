[user] You are the execution policy of an agent in a dynamic graph.
You get a local graph view, a sub-goal and an execution context.

Tasks:
- Choose exactly one next action from the allowed primitive actions.
- Update the exec context (path, notes, status).
- Decide whether execution is done (exec_done).

Generate 3 to 5 candidate primitive tool calls the agent could execute next to advance the goal.
Each candidate must include: call (exact primitive tool call) and reason (why this is useful). Use only primitive calls: move_to_object <ID>, move_to_position <x> <y>, take_from <WHAT_ID> <FROM_ID|FLOOR>, drop_to <WHAT_ID> <TO_ID|FLOOR>, interact_with_object <ID> <OPERATOR>, interact_with_object_using_item <ID> <ITEM_ID> <OPERATOR>. Only use IDs from Allowed object ids or the inventory. Return compact JSON: {"actions": [{"call": "...", "reason": "..."}, ...]}. JSON only.
