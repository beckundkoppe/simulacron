Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [189] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan only states the high‑level goal “find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.” It does not break the task into actionable substeps such as:

1. Locate the cucumber (search the room, identify its position).  
2. Move to the cucumber.  
3. Pick it up.  
4. Locate the table.  
5. Move to the table.  
6. Place the cucumber on the table.

Without these decomposed actions, the agent cannot execute the plan. Therefore the plan tree needs to be expanded into these concrete steps before execution can begin.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree still contains high‑level subgoals that are not atomic actions.  
- “Find the cucumber” requires moving to the location where the cucumber is, searching the area, and confirming that it is the cucumber.  
- “Pick up the cucumber” requires being adjacent to it and executing a pick‑up action.  
- “Place the cucumber on the table” requires moving to the table and performing a place action.  

These subgoals need to be broken down into concrete, executable actions before the plan can be executed.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5).

**Facts in the new state**

| Object | Position | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | on the floor |

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber is indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The path from (0,0) to (3.5,1.5) is unobstructed.  
3. The cucumber is not already being held.  
4. The human can see the cucumber once at that location.

**Which assumptions held?**

- Assumptions 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all correct.  
- No assumption was contradicted by the action’s outcome.

**What remains to be done**

The cucumber has not yet been picked up or placed on the table; the next minimal actions are:  
1. `pick up cucumber`  
2. `move to (3.5, 0.5)`  
3. `place cucumber on table`.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- Human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 0.5).  
- Cucumber was placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Inventory is now empty.

**Facts in the new state**

| Object   | Position | Status          |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 0.5) | on the floor   |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table   |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | on the floor   |

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber was in the human’s inventory.  
2. The table was at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. The human could place the cucumber on the table.  
4. No obstruction prevented the placement.

**Which assumptions held?**

All four assumptions were correct; none were contradicted by the outcome.

The last action successfully placed the cucumber on the table, leaving the human at (3.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory. This satisfies the goal “place the cucumber on the table,” so the focused plan node is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: Yes.  
The cucumber is now on the table at (3.5, 0.5), and the human is at that location with an empty inventory. All three required actions—finding the cucumber, picking it up, and placing it on the table—have been completed. The goal is satisfied.

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [193] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the plan tree is still at the top‑level goal node and has not been broken down into executable actions.  
To start execution we need to decompose the goal into a sequence of primitive actions, e.g.:

1. `move to (3.5, 1.5)`  
2. `pick up cucumber`  
3. `move to (3.5, 0.5)`  
4. `place cucumber on table`

Only after this decomposition can the agent begin executing the plan.

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [193] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refinement of the current plan tree**

- **Node 193** (current focus) → **decompose** into the following minimal sub‑tasks:

| Sub‑node | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 193.1 | `move to (3.5, 1.5)` (reach the cucumber) |
| 193.2 | `pick up cucumber` |
| 193.3 | `move to (3.5, 0.5)` (reach the table) |
| 193.4 | `place cucumber on table` |

These four actions are the minimal sequence that achieves the goal and nothing else. No further decomposition or pruning is needed.

[user] Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Plan tree:
- [193] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

                    Use decompose_node(task_node_id, sub_nodes) to split tasks, delete_node(task_node_id, delete_children)
                     to remove or merge tasks, mark_done(task_node_id) to label completed nodes
                     mark_focued(task_node_id) to set the next focus. Use only the provided plan editing tools to update the plan tree.
                    Update like this: **Refinement of the current plan tree**

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [193] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)
  - [194] move to (3.5, 1.5) (reach the cucumber)
  - [195] pick up cucumber
  - [196] move to (3.5, 0.5) (reach the table)
  - [197] place cucumber on table

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes.  
The plan tree has been fully decomposed into atomic actions that the agent can execute directly:

1. `move to (3.5, 1.5)` – reach the cucumber.  
2. `pick up cucumber` – acquire the object.  
3. `move to (3.5, 0.5)` – reach the table.  
4. `place cucumber on table` – complete the goal.

All sub‑tasks are concrete, executable actions with no further sub‑decomposition needed. Therefore the plan is ready for execution.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- Cucumber remains in the human’s inventory.  
- Table stays at (3.5, 0.5).

**Facts in the new state**

| Object   | Position | Status          |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor   |
| Cucumber | in inventory | held by human |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | on the floor   |

**Assumptions made**

1. The path from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.5) was unobstructed.  
2. The human could move to the target location.  
3. The cucumber remained in the human’s inventory.  
4. The table’s position did not change.

**Which assumptions held?**

All four assumptions held true; none were contradicted by the outcome.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The last reflection confirms that the human has moved from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and is now at the cucumber’s location. Therefore the focused plan node “move to (3.5, 1.5)” is completed.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- Human moved to (3.5, 1.5).  
- Cucumber was picked up and is now in the human’s inventory.  
- Table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.

**Current facts**

| Cucumber | in inventory | held by human |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | on the floor   |

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The path to the cucumber was unobstructed.  
3. The cucumber was not already held.  
4. The human could pick it up.

**Assumptions verified**

All four assumptions held true; none were contradicted by the outcome.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 0.5).  
- Cucumber remains in the human’s inventory.  
- Table stays at (3.5, 0.5).

**Facts in the new state**

**Assumptions made**

1. The path from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.5) was unobstructed.  
2. The human can move to the target location.  
3. The cucumber remains in the human’s inventory.  
4. The table’s position does not change.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The plan node was to “move to (3.5, 0.5)”. The last reflection shows the human is already at (3.5, 0.5), so that movement goal has been satisfied. Thus the focused plan node is completed.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Place cucumber on table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
