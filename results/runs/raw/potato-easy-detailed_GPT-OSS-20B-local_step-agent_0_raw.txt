[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- **Fact:** The human agent is now at coordinates (4, 4).  
- **Fact:** No objects (potato, table, etc.) were moved or interacted with, so their locations remain unchanged.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. **Movement feasibility:** The path from (0, 0) to (4, 4) is clear (no walls or obstacles).  
2. **Room mapping:** The coordinates (4, 4) correspond to the “other room” where the potato is expected to be.

**Verification of assumptions**

- **Assumption 1** – *Correct.* The action succeeded, indicating a clear path.  
- **Assumption 2** – *Unverified.* We have not yet confirmed that (4, 4) is indeed the other room or that the potato is there; further exploration is required.

No physical action was taken; the agent only observed the potato at (4, 4). The environment state remains unchanged.

- Key: (3, 1)

1. The door at (4, 4) was open.  
2. The key remained at (3, 1).  
3. The table at (0, 3) stayed empty.  
4. The potato was not present in this room before the observation.

### Effect of the performed actions  

| Fact after the actions | Explanation |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Human** at `(0,3)` | The last move brought the agent to the table’s location. |
| **Potato** on the table at `(0,3)` | The potato was taken from the floor at `(4,4)` and placed on the empty table. |
| **Key** still at `(3,1)` | No action touched the key. |
| **Door** at `(4,4)` remains **open** | No action closed or opened the door. |

---

### Assumptions made about the new state  

1. The table at `(0,3)` can hold the potato.  
2. Moving from `(4,4)` to `(0,3)` is possible (no obstacles).  
3. `place potato` will put the potato on the table, not on the floor.  

---

### Verification of assumptions  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Table can hold potato | **Proved right** – potato now sits on the table. |
| Path to `(0,3)` is clear | **Proved right** – human successfully moved there. |
| `place potato` puts it on the table | **Proved right** – potato is now on the table at `(0,3)`. |

All assumptions held true.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Item | New state |
|------|-----------|
| **Human** | (0, 3) – moved from (4, 4) to the table’s location |
| **Potato** | on the table at (0, 3) – removed from the floor at (4, 4) |
| **Key** | (3, 1) – unchanged |
| **Door** | (4, 4), open – untouched |

**Assumptions made**

1. The table at (0, 3) can hold the potato.  
2. The path from (4, 4) to (0, 3) is clear.  
3. `place potato` puts it on the table, not on the floor.

**Verification**

All three assumptions proved right.
