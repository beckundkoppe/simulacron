- Moved to (4,0). No potato observed here.  

**Facts:**

**Assumptions:**  
- Potato may exist in unexplored areas like (4,1), (5,0), or other positions.  
- Potato’s location remains unknown.  

**Proven/Disproven Assumptions:**  
- Potato not present in (4,0) (disproven).  
- Potato may exist in remaining unexplored regions (assumed but unverified).  

**Next Steps:** Continue searching unexplored positions (e.g., (4,1), (5,0)) to locate the potato.

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Moved to **(1,4)** and confirmed no potato is present here.  

**Facts:**  
- Table at **(0,3)** remains empty.  
- Door at **(4,4)** is open and unlocked.  
- All previously checked positions (**(4,1)**, **(4,2)**, **(4,3)**, **(0,4)**, **(3,4)**, **(2,4)**, **(1,4)**) lack the potato.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Potato may exist in unvisited coordinates like **(1,5)**, **(0,4)**, or **(2,5)**.  
- Potato could be in a position not yet checked within the room.  

**Proven/Disproven Assumptions:**  
- **Disproven:** All checked positions (including **(1,4)**) lack the potato.  
- **Unverified:** No new discoveries confirm the potato’s location.  

**Next Steps:** Continue checking remaining room coordinates (e.g., **(1,5)**, **(0,4)**) within boundaries. If no potato is found, the task cannot be completed without additional information.
