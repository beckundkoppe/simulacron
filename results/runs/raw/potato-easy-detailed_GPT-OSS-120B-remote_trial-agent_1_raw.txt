Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [174] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan is still high‑level. To execute it we need concrete, ordered actions such as moving between rooms, searching for the potato, picking it up, and then moving to the table and putting it down. Therefore the current plan tree should be further decomposed into those specific steps before execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refine node 174 into the following minimal sub‑steps:**

1. **Move to the other room** – navigate through any doors or passages to reach the room that contains the potato.  
2. **Locate the potato** – search the room (look at surfaces, inside containers, etc.) until the potato is identified.  
3. **Take the potato** – pick up the potato.  
4. **Return to the room with the table** – go back through the same passage(s) to the room where the table is located.  
5. **Place the potato on the table** – drop the potato onto the table’s surface.  

These five actions constitute the complete, minimal sequence to achieve the goal.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan is still at a high‑level description (move to the other room, locate the potato, etc.). To start execution we need concrete actions such as which direction to walk, whether a door must be opened or unlocked, how to look around or inspect containers, and the exact “pick up” and “drop” commands. Because those low‑level steps are missing, the tree is **not yet sufficiently decomposed** for execution. It should be broken down into explicit actions (e.g., “walk north to the door”, “open door”, “enter room”, “look at the counter”, “take potato”, “walk back to table”, “drop potato on table”).

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is already broken down into concrete, low‑level steps (move to the other room, locate the potato, take it, return to the table’s room, and place it). Each sub‑task is an atomic action that the human can execute directly, so we can start carrying them out.
