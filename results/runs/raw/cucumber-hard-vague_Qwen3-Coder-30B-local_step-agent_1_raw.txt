[observer] I observe a cucumber positioned at (3.5, 1.5) and a table at (3.5, 0.5). The cucumber is directly adjacent to the table's surface. The table is described as a sturdy oak table with carved legs and burn marks from candles. The chest at (2.0, 2.0) is closed but unlocked, and there's a potato at (0.5, 1.5).

The table's position is (3.5, 0.5) and the cucumber's position is (3.5, 1.5), so the cucumber is directly above the table. The table is described as having "a few burn marks from candles" and is "sturdy oak with carved legs."

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**
- Player moved to chest_5 location
- Player opened chest_5

**Assumptions about new state:**
- Chest contained items/loot
- Chest was accessible/available
- Movement was successful

**Assumptions proven right:**
- Chest_5 existed and was reachable
- Opening action was successful

**Assumptions proven wrong:**
- No information about what was actually inside the chest
- No information about whether chest was previously locked or empty
- No information about consequences of opening (e.g., traps, enemies, rewards)

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observations:**
- Cucumber is at position (3.5, 1.5) - **NEW DISCOVERY**
- Chest_5 is at position (2.0, 2.0) and is open/unlocked - **VERIFIED FACT**
- Table_4 is at position (3.5, 0.5) - **VERIFIED FACT**
- Potato_6 is at position (0.5, 1.5) - **VERIFIED FACT**

**Relevant for goal:**
- Cucumber is now in the room and can be interacted with
- Chest_5 is open and empty (no loot)
- Table_4 is available for placing items

**New discovery:** Cucumber is present in the room at (3.5, 1.5) - this is the only new information not already in the facts or assumptions.
