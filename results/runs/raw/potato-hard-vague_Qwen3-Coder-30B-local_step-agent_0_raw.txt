[reflector] **Facts:**

- I collected key_7
- I moved from (3.0,1.0) to door_8
- Door_8 was already unlocked
- I went through door_8 into chamber

**Assumptions that proved right:**
- The key_7 was collectible
- Door_8 was unlocked (no need to unlock it)
- The chamber was accessible through door_8

**Effect:** I successfully navigated to the chamber through the unlocked door, collecting a key along the way. The key may be needed for future door operations, but it's not required for the current task.

[reflector] **Effect:** Successfully moved to table position (0.0,4.0)

**Facts:**
- Table_4 is at (0.0,4.0) and currently empty
- I am now at (0.0,4.0) position
- No potato currently on table

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Table_4 is reachable from current position
- Table_4 is at the expected location (0.0,4.0)

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- None explicitly stated

**No new discoveries** about potato placement - the potato still needs to be placed on the table.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (0.0,1.0)
[ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,1.0) to door_8
[ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_8 into main
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect:** Successfully moved through door_8 into main chamber

**Facts:**
- I am now in main chamber at (0.0,1.0)
- Door_8 is at (0.0,1.0) and open/unlocked
- Box_11 at (0.0,0.0) contains potato_9
- I have key_7 and diamond_10 in inventory

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Door_8 is open/unlocked and accessible
- Can move through door_8

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- None explicitly stated

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observation:**

I observe:
- Door_8 at (4.0,4.0) is open/unlocked
- Box_6 at (1.0,1.0) is empty
- Table_4 at (0.0,4.0) contains diamond_5

**Relevant for goal:** None - all facts match previous perception data. No new discoveries.

**Note:** I am currently in the main chamber at (4.0,4.0), but the goal was to get potato_9 into box_11, which has already been accomplished. The current position is at the edge of the main chamber, not the room where the box_11 is located.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to box_11 at (0.0,0.0) to verify potato_9 is inside, then move to table_4 at (0.0,4.0) to place potato_9 on table, then move to door_8 at (4.0,4.0) to exit chamber.
