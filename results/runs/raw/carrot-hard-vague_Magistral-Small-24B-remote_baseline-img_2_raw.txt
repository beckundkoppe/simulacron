The move_to_position was incorrect. Let me re-evaluate based on the given actions and parameters.\n\nRevised Plan:\n1. Move to the object with id `table_3`.\n\nFinal Tool Call:\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut, the problem\'s reasoning says \'Reasoning: Go to table at (1.0, 4.0) Task\'.\nSo I assumed using move_to_position was correct.\nHowever, function definitions provided only have move_to_object and not move_to_position.\n\nDouble-checking:\nLooking back at the functions available:\n\nmovetoObject is for moving by object_id only. There\'s no function to directly input coordinates under the given functions.\n\nBut task says "Go to position (1.0,4.0)".\nThis is conflicting with the functions since there\'s move_to_position and move_to_object functions available but in the initial problem description as per the user\'s request, both are present.\nIn the first line of tool definitions:\nmove_to_position: takes x,y coordinates\nmove_to_object: takes object_id.\n\nGiven that task reason says "Go to table at (1.0,4.0)" and we know the table is table_3 at  (1.0,4.0), both function calls are accurate\nBut which one should be preferred?\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe reasoning explicitly asks to go to position (1.0,4.0),\nnot just the table.\nHowever, the table is positioned there.\n\nFor clarity: using move_to_object with object_id "table_3" would indirectly place the human at position (1.0,4.0) by moving towards it.\nBut if precise coordinates are needed regardless of objects, then move_to_position should be used.\n\nIn this context, since (1.0,4.0) is the table\'s exact position and the task asks to go there without specifying object interaction yet, either function could be used,\nbut **move_to_object** is more specific for this scenario as it directly references known elements.\n\nGiven problem constraints and clarity:\n- Use move_object with table_3 since we are specifically asked to go to the table\'s location at (1.0,4.0)\n\nHowever, if user explicitly wants exact coordinate-based movement independent of objects in room (which is highly unlikely in this context but possible), move_to_position should be chosen.\n\nRe-evaluating user\'s exact request wording:\n\n"Go to table at (1.0, 4.0)"\n\nThus object-centric approach aligns perfectly.\nFinal decision: use `move_to_object`.\n\nTherefore the correct and most efficient tool call is\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, the initial instructions were about giving tool calls arising from planned actions based on reasoning. And reasoning says to go to position (1.0,4.0), not necessarily using an object function.\nIf move_to_position is available in tools and we have explicit coordinates, it seems logical to use that to directly reach the location instead of moving towards an object which happens to be at that location.\n\nUnless there\'s a constraint on preferred methods for movement—like always preferring objects as navigation points over raw coordinates—the most direct approach aligns with task description through `move_to_position`.\n\nGiven functions present (including move_to_position), and task asking to go to coordinate:\nFinal answer should use position-based movement.\n\nBut, the function `move_to_object` could implicitly achieve this if table is target. Yet since we have both, priority remains with direct positional command unless constrained otherwise.\nHowever, reviewing available tools:\nmove_to_position has parameters x,y which need string input, but coordinates are numbers here: (1.0,4.0) -> so passing as x: "1.0", y:"4.0" would work.\n\nSimilarly move_to_object has one parameter object_id which is table_3 for this case.\n\nWhich one matches reasoning better? The text says:\n\nReasoning: Go to position at (1.0, 4.0)\nThus direct positional movement matches task description literally.\nSo `move_to_position` with x= "1.0" and y="4.0"\nWhile `move_to_object table_3` would have the same result in this specific case but not generalize to arbitrary positions.\n\nTherefore to strictly follow task instructions which specify a *position* as target, `move_to_position` is appropriate\n\nHowever: in current environment, is there any difference if human moves directly to coordinate (1.0,4.0) versus moving towards object at that position?\nIn terms of state outcomes probably none. But function-based approach must follow given task.\n\nGiven task explicitly says:\nReasoning: Go to table [i.e object] at (position 1.0,4.0).\nThis phrasing is ambiguous: either\n(A) there is a table object which happens to be at that coordinate\nor (B) we should go generally to the position; the table being present is additional info.\n\nGiven the latter interpretation is about positions not objects directly, move_to_position must be used even if table coincides at that spot.\nBut in most intuitive reading: task wants us to go to table object located there. Hence move_to_object is natural choice despite coordinates being mentioned as secondary info (table\'s location).\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity definitively, let\'s consider the exact wording in the problem introduction:\n" Reasoning: Go to table at (1.0, 4.0)"\nThe verb is "go to table"... suggesting primary target is table object (with its position noted in parentheses as extra info).\nThus move_to_object with table_3 aligns.\n\nTherefore even if coordinates are mentioned as part of reasoning for where the object lies, main task is reaching the table object, not the coordinate as an empty space.\nHence final correct toolcall: move_to_object for table_3\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nGiven the reasoning and task, the specific action needed to go to the table at `(1.0, 4.0)` is achieved by moving to the object identified as `table_3`.\n\n### Tool Calls:\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\texttt{move\\_to\\_object(object\\_id="table\\_3")}}' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1920, 'prompt_tokens': 1371, 'total_tokens': 3291, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-599', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b00d4-6de5-7a42-bc2d-922947ce21bf-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1371, 'output_tokens': 1920, 'total_tokens': 3291, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

There\'s no function to directly input coordinates under the given functions.\n\nBut task says "Go to position (1.0,4.0)".\nThis is conflicting with the functions since there\'s move_to_position and move_to_object functions available but in the initial problem description as per the user\'s request, both are present.\nIn the first line of tool definitions:\nmove_to_position: takes x,y coordinates\nmove_to_object: takes object_id.\n\nGiven that task reason says "Go to table at (1.0,4.0)" and we know the table is table_3 at  (1.0,4.0), both function calls are accurate\nBut which one should be preferred?\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe reasoning explicitly asks to go to position (1.0,4.0),\nnot just the table.\nHowever, the table is positioned there.\n\nFor clarity: using move_to_object with object_id "table_3" would indirectly place the human at position (1.0,4.0) by moving towards it.\nBut if precise coordinates are needed regardless of objects, then move_to_position should be used.\n\nIn this context, since (1.0,4.0) is the table\'s exact position and the task asks to go there without specifying object interaction yet, either function could be used,\nbut **move_to_object** is more specific for this scenario as it directly references known elements.\n\nGiven problem constraints and clarity:\n- Use move_object with table_3 since we are specifically asked to go to the table\'s location at (1.0,4.0)\n\nHowever, if user explicitly wants exact coordinate-based movement independent of objects in room (which is highly unlikely in this context but possible), move_to_position should be chosen.\n\nRe-evaluating user\'s exact request wording:\n\n"Go to table at (1.0, 4.0)"\n\nThus object-centric approach aligns perfectly.\nFinal decision: use `move_to_object`.\n\nTherefore the correct and most efficient tool call is\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, the initial instructions were about giving tool calls arising from planned actions based on reasoning. And reasoning says to go to position (1.0,4.0), not necessarily using an object function.\nIf move_to_position is available in tools and we have explicit coordinates, it seems logical to use that to directly reach the location instead of moving towards an object which happens to be at that location.\n\nUnless there\'s a constraint on preferred methods for movement—like always preferring objects as navigation points over raw coordinates—the most direct approach aligns with task description through `move_to_position`.\n\nGiven functions present (including move_to_position), and task asking to go to coordinate:\nFinal answer should use position-based movement.\n\nBut, the function `move_to_object` could implicitly achieve this if table is target. Yet since we have both, priority remains with direct positional command unless constrained otherwise.\nHowever, reviewing available tools:\nmove_to_position has parameters x,y which need string input, but coordinates are numbers here: (1.0,4.0) -> so passing as x: "1.0", y:"4.0" would work.\n\nSimilarly move_to_object has one parameter object_id which is table_3 for this case.\n\nWhich one matches reasoning better? The text says:\n\nReasoning: Go to position at (1.0, 4.0)\nThus direct positional movement matches task description literally.\nSo `move_to_position` with x= "1.0" and y="4.0"\nWhile `move_to_object table_3` would have the same result in this specific case but not generalize to arbitrary positions.\n\nTherefore to strictly follow task instructions which specify a *position* as target, `move_to_position` is appropriate\n\nHowever: in current environment, is there any difference if human moves directly to coordinate (1.0,4.0) versus moving towards object at that position?\nIn terms of state outcomes probably none. But function-based approach must follow given task.\n\nGiven task explicitly says:\nReasoning: Go to table [i.e object] at (position 1.0,4.0).\nThis phrasing is ambiguous: either\n(A) there is a table object which happens to be at that coordinate\nor (B) we should go generally to the position; the table being present is additional info.\n\nGiven the latter interpretation is about positions not objects directly, move_to_position must be used even if table coincides at that spot.\nBut in most intuitive reading: task wants us to go to table object located there. Hence move_to_object is natural choice despite coordinates being mentioned as secondary info (table\'s location).\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity definitively, let\'s consider the exact wording in the problem introduction:\n" Reasoning: Go to table at (1.0, 4.0)"\nThe verb is "go to table"... suggesting primary target is table object (with its position noted in parentheses as extra info).\nThus move_to_object with table_3 aligns.\n\nTherefore even if coordinates are mentioned as part of reasoning for where the object lies, main task is reaching the table object, not the coordinate as an empty space.\nHence final correct toolcall: move_to_object for table_3\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nGiven the reasoning and task, the specific action needed to go to the table at `(1.0, 4.0)` is achieved by moving to the object identified as `table_3`.\n\n### Tool Calls:\n\n```json\n{\n  "toolcall": {\n    "move_to_object": {\n      "object_id": "table_3"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\texttt{move\\_to\\_object(object\\_id="table\\_3")}}'}]}For toolcalls, use the following syntax: {"name": "<tool_name>", "args": {"<arg_key>": "<arg_value>"}}.
