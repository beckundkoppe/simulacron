Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [349] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan tree has only a single abstract goal (Place a potato on the table) with no primitive actions (move, take, drop) or conditional checks. To execute in a 2D environment, we must decompose into actionable steps and handle possible states (potato location, your location, etc.).

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed. Use this minimal decomposition (branch as needed by state):
- If potato is not in hand:
  - Move to potato
  - Take potato
- Move to table
- Drop potato on table

Optional optimization: if potato is already in hand and you are at the table, just drop. If potato is already on the table, the goal is achieved with no further action.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan is a single conditional with a complete, linear sequence for the main case (move to potato, pick up, move to table, place). The else branch handles the already-achieved state by pruning. All actions are atomic, and the branches cover both outcomes. Therefore it’s adequately decomposed to start.

Decision: Yes, start execution.  
- Evaluate: if potato is not on the table, execute 351 → 354 (move to potato, pick up, move to table, put on table).  
- If already on the table, perform 355 (prune / no action).

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

- Move to the table at (0.0, 3.0)

[reflector] Effect of the action:
- You moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0, 3.0). No potato interaction occurred; nothing was placed on the table.

Facts after the action:
- Your position: (0.0, 3.0)
- Table contents: empty
- Potato: not observed in room; not in inventory
- Door: closed; unlocked
- Key: at (3.0, 1.0)

Assumptions about the new state:
- Potato exists somewhere in the room or in inventory and can be placed on the table.
- Being at the table would allow placing the potato if it were available.

Which assumptions were right/wrong:
- Right: The table is at (0.0, 3.0) and is empty.
- Wrong/Unverified: The potato is available to place right now (you do not have it yet). The plan to place the potato was not fulfilled.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: Plan 349.1 assumes you have the potato to place on the table. Right now the potato is not observed, not in inventory, and no action has yielded or moved the potato. The table remains empty and there’s no progress toward placing the potato.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [356] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The plan is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Reason: To place the potato on the table you must first have the potato (in inventory or in hand). The potato is not observed, so there are no subgoals to locate or retrieve it. Starting with just "Place a potato on the table" assumes you already possess the potato, which you do not.

Recommended minimal decomposition:
- Locate the potato.
- Move to the potato’s location (if not already there).
- Take (pick up) the potato.
- Place the potato on the table (drop).

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
Since the potato is not in inventory and not visible, the only applicable branch is 356.3 (search by moving to a new location). The plan already covers what happens if it becomes visible (356.2.1) or if the search continues. Therefore the plan is sufficiently decomposed to start, though it remains high-level about how to search.

Decision:
Yes. Start execution with 356.3: Move to a new location to search for the potato (then, if it becomes visible, branch to 356.2; if not, continue searching or conclude).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.

Reason: The plan 356.3 says to move to a new location to search for the potato if it’s not in inventory and not visible, repeating until the potato is seen or the search space is exhausted. You’ve only moved once to (1.0, 3.0) and the potato remains unseen and not in inventory. The search space is not exhausted, so the plan is not completed. 

Optionally, the next minimal action would be to move to another new location (e.g., (2.0, 3.0)) to continue the search.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan targets finding the potato by moving to a new location if it’s not visible. You’ve just moved to a new position (1.0, 3.0) and the potato is still not visible, so progress toward locating it exists. There’s no repetition or stalled state.

Yes, the plan is still promising.

Next action (optional): Move to a new location to search for the potato, e.g., move to (2.0, 3.0).

[reflector] - Effect of action: You moved from (1.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 3.0). No potato interaction occurred.

- Current facts:
  - Your position: (2.0, 3.0)
  - Table contents: empty (table at (0.0, 3.0))
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: at (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked
  - (Table location remains (0.0, 3.0))

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or in inventory and can be placed on the table (assumed)
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue searching or conclude if search space exhausted

- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: Table is at (0.0, 3.0) and empty; Door/lock state unchanged; You are now at (2.0, 3.0).
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory). This remains unverified. The potato has not yet been found.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Plan status: Not completed.

Reasoning (short): Plan 356.3 requires you to move to a new location to search for the potato. You are currently at (2.0, 3.0) with the potato still not visible and not in inventory, so the required relocation step hasn’t been executed yet.

Decision: Not completed. Execute the next minimal action to satisfy the plan.

Next minimal action: Move to a new location, e.g., Move to (3.0, 3.0).

Notes: If the potato becomes visible on arrival, branch to 356.2.1. If still not found, continue searching or conclude if search space is exhausted.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You’ve been following plan 356.3 by moving to new locations to search for the potato. No potato seen yet, but you’re making progress toward the search and not repeating an ineffective action. Therefore the plan remains applicable.

  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: at (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or in inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue searching or conclude if search space exhausted

- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: Table location (0.0, 3.0) and empty; Door/lock state unchanged; You are now at (4.0, 3.0)
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory). This remains unverified.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
The potato hasn’t been found and isn’t in inventory, so 356.3 (move to a new location to search) is still the correct next step. You’ve been moving to new search spots, so the plan is still aligning with the current situation. The goal (finding the potato) hasn’t progressed yet, but the plan remains valid and worth continuing until the search space is exhausted.

Answer: Yes, the plan 356.3 is still promising. Proceed by moving to another new location to search for the potato.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- Plan 356.3 says to move to a new location to search for the potato as long as it’s not in inventory and not visible. We have not found the potato yet, so the plan is still active. We have already moved to a new location (4,0), but the potato remains unseen, so we need to continue the search. The search space is not exhausted.

Decision:
- The plan is not completed.

Next minimal action (to continue the plan):
- Move to a new location: Move from (4.0, 0.0) to (4.0, 1.0). This is the nearest unvisited location, and keeps the action sequence minimal.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The potato remains unseen and not in inventory, so the condition for 356.3 still holds. You have just moved to a new search location (4.0,0.0), which counts as progress toward the plan. Therefore continue with 356.3 by moving to another new location to search for the potato. Next action could be moving to a further unexplored coordinate (e.g., 4.0,1.0).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: The potato remains unseen and not in inventory, so the condition for 356.3 still holds. You have just moved to a new search location (4.0,0.0), which counts as progress toward the plan. Therefore continue with 356.3 by moving to another new location to search for the potato. Next action could be moving to a further unexplored coordinate (e.g., 4.0,1.0).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: Plan 356.3 continues until the potato is found or the search space is exhausted. The potato is still not observed or in inventory, and there are still unsearched areas, so the plan should continue with another move to a new location to search. 

Next action (suggested): Move to a new location to search for the potato, e.g., from (0.0, 4.0) to (0.0, 2.0).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason: Plan 356.3 continues until the potato is found or the search space is exhausted. The potato is still not observed or in inventory, and there are still unsearched areas, so the plan should continue with another move to a new location to search. 

Next action (suggested): Move to a new location to search for the potato, e.g., from (0.0, 4.0) to (0.0, 2.0).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You just moved to a new location (0,4) as the plan 356.3 prescribes and potato remains unseen; the search space is still open, and you’re not repeating a previous location. Therefore, continuing to move to new locations to search for the potato remains appropriate.

Plan viability: Yes.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: You just moved to a new location (0,4) as the plan 356.3 prescribes and potato remains unseen; the search space is still open, and you’re not repeating a previous location. Therefore, continuing to move to new locations to search for the potato remains appropriate.

Plan viability: Yes.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan 356.3 remains active because the potato is not in inventory and not visible, and we have not exhausted the search space or placed the potato. No success or exhaustion condition has been reached yet.

Answer:
- Plan completed? No.

Reason in brief:
- We still need to continue searching (move to a new location) to satisfy the plan’s condition for continuing the search. The potato has not been found, and there’s no evidence that the search space is exhausted. Next step would be to move to a new location to search for the potato.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- The plan 356.3 remains active because the potato is not in inventory and not visible, and we have not exhausted the search space or placed the potato. No success or exhaustion condition has been reached yet.

Answer:
- Plan completed? No.

Reason in brief:
- We still need to continue searching (move to a new location) to satisfy the plan’s condition for continuing the search. The potato has not been found, and there’s no evidence that the search space is exhausted. Next step would be to move to a new location to search for the potato.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan 356.3 requires moving to a new location when the potato isn’t in inventory or visible. You just moved to (0.0, 2.0), a new location, and the potato remains unseen. This is progress toward the planned search and is not a loop.

Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan 356.3 requires moving to a new location when the potato isn’t in inventory or visible. You just moved to (0.0, 2.0), a new location, and the potato remains unseen. This is progress toward the planned search and is not a loop.

Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The potato has not been found or observed, and the plan 356.3 continues by moving to a new location to search. The search space is not shown to be exhausted, so the plan is not complete.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed yet. The potato is still not found, and we should continue by moving to a new location to search for it. If you want, I can pick the next location and execute the move.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You’ve continued moving to new locations in the search area and the potato remains unseen. This aligns with plan 356.3, so there is still progress toward locating the potato and you are not stuck in a repeating, non-modifying pattern.

Decision: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Next step (suggested): Move to another new location to continue searching for the potato.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,1.0) to (4.0,1.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Action effect: You moved from (0.0,1.0) to (4.0,1.0); no potato interaction or placement.
- Current facts:
  - Your position: (4.0, 1.0)
  - Table: at (0.0, 3.0), empty
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: at (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4
- Assumptions about the new state (from the plan):
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue searching
- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: The move to a new location to search was executed; you are now at (4.0, 1.0); table remains empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Reason: Plan 356.3 continues until either the potato becomes visible (356.2.1) or the search space is exhausted. The potato is still not observed and not in inventory, and there are likely unsearched locations in the 4x4 room, so the search is not yet exhausted. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Next suggested action: move to a new location that hasn’t been searched yet to continue the potato search.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. Reason: Plan 356.3 continues until either the potato becomes visible (356.2.1) or the search space is exhausted. The potato is still not observed and not in inventory, and there are likely unsearched locations in the 4x4 room, so the search is not yet exhausted. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Next suggested action: move to a new location that hasn’t been searched yet to continue the potato search.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The potato remains unseen and not in inventory, so the defined plan 356.3 (move to a new location to search) is still applicable. There has been no state that ends the search or proves the potato unavailable; relocation is the required next step to satisfy the plan.

Next action (minimal): Move to (0.0, 0.0).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: The potato remains unseen and not in inventory, so the defined plan 356.3 (move to a new location to search) is still applicable. There has been no state that ends the search or proves the potato unavailable; relocation is the required next step to satisfy the plan.

Next action (minimal): Move to (0.0, 0.0).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Action reflection:

- Effect of action: Moved from (4.0, 1.0) to (4.0, 4.0); no potato interaction or placement.

- Current facts after action:
  - Position: (4.0, 4.0)
  - Table contents: empty; table at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: at (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue searching or conclude if search space exhausted

- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: The move to a new location to search was executed; you are now at (4.0, 4.0); table remains empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: The plan 356.3 continues until the potato is found (356.2.1) or the search space is exhausted. The potato is still not visible and not in inventory, and the search space has not been exhausted—there are still possible locations to check. Therefore the plan remains active. Next action would be to move to a new location to continue searching.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan 356.3 hinges on moving to new locations to find the potato and only pivots if the potato becomes visible. Recent actions have yielded no potato visibility and no state change toward locating it, and you seem to be cycling through locations without progress. This makes the plan unlikely to succeed without a new insight or change in state.

Answer: No.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [360] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan tree contains only the goal “Place a potato on the table” without any steps to obtain the potato. Since the potato isn’t visible and isn’t in inventory, you cannot execute the placing action yet. You need a decomposition that handles finding or obtaining the potato first, then moving to the table and placing it.

Recommended decomposed plan (minimal but complete to execute):
- 360.1 Check inventory for potato.
  - If potato in inventory -> proceed to 360.5 (Move to table and place).
- 360.2 If potato not in inventory, search for potato in the room:
  - 360.2.1 Look around current view; if potato becomes visible -> 356.2.1 (pick up potato) and continue.
  - 360.2.2 If not visible, move to a new search location (systematic sweep).
  - 360.2.3 Repeat 360.2.1–360.2.2 until potato is found or search space is exhausted.
- 360.3 If potato has been obtained (from inventory or by picking up):
  - 360.3.1 Move to the table at (0.0, 3.0).
  - 360.3.2 Place potato on the table.
- 360.4 If the potato cannot be found after exhausting search, report failure (plan ends).

This decomposition preserves the minimal-action principle by only advancing to the next concrete step after confirming whether the potato is already in inventory or has been located.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [360] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here is a concise refinement of the plan to accomplish “Place a potato on the table,” with decomposition and pruning guidance.

Refined plan tree (concise)
- 360. Place a potato on the table
  - 360.1 AcquirePotato
    - 360.1.1 If potato is visible now: Take potato (action: take)
    - 360.1.2 Else: Systematic sweep search to cover the room
      - Strategy: sweep the room (perimeter first, then interior) to maximize new area seen with minimal repeats
      - This sweep is designed to terminate early if potato becomes visible
  - 360.2 MoveToTableAndPlace
    - 360.2.1 Move to table location: (0, 3)
    - 360.2.2 Drop potato (placing on the table)
  - 360.3 EndIfNotFound
    - If after a single sweep the potato was not found, prune this path and report failure to place

Concise pruning guidance
- Prune if 360.1.2 Sweep has completed without ever seeing a potato:
  - Outcome: potato not found; cannot place; abort plan (or switch to alternate objective if allowed).
- Prune subpath 360.2.2 (placing) if 360.2.1 cannot be reached due to an intervening constraint (e.g., door locked and blocking path) unless you have a way around it.

Rationale
- The potato is not in inventory and not currently visible; the only way to place one is to find it first.
- A minimal, systematic sweep minimizes wasted moves while guaranteeing eventual discovery if present.
- Once found, picking up and returning to the table (0,3) for placement is the direct path to the goal.

If you want, I can propose a concrete numeric sweep path (a specific sequence of coordinates) to execute next.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. It risks attempting to place potato without actually having it (360.2 assumes dropping without ensuring possession), and it doesn’t explicitly encode the necessary movement steps from the agent’s current location to the table. It also lacks a clean conditional that only proceeds to placing when the potato is in inventory, and it doesn’t tightly tie the “found during sweep” event to an immediate acquire-and-place flow.

Recommendation (a tightened plan, minimal actions, starting from current state):
- 360.0 Goal: Place a potato on the table.

- Branch A: If potato is visible now
  - 360.1 Take potato (action: take)
  - 360.2 MoveToTableAndPlace
    - 360.2.1 Move to table location: (0, 3)
    - 360.2.2 Drop potato (placing on the table)
  - 360.3 End

- Branch B: If potato not visible now
  - 360.4 SweepRoomForPotatoUntilFound
    - Sweep perimeter first, then interior; if potato becomes visible during sweep, go to 360.5
  - 360.5 If potato found during sweep
    - 360.5.1 Take potato (if not already)
    - 360.5.2 MoveToTableAndPlace (as in 360.2)
  - 360.6 If not found after sweep
    - 360.6.1 End (report failure to place)

Notes for execution:
- MoveToTableAndPlace should be conditional on actually possessing the potato. If not, skip to End or continue searching.
- From the current state (you’re at 4,4), the MoveToTable step would be a single action to go to (0,3) before dropping, once you have the potato.
- This keeps the plan minimal while ensuring correctness (you can’t drop what you don’t have).

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed. Use the revised structure above to start execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Nice: plan goal is to place a potato on the table. Since the potato hasn’t been seen and inventory is empty, you should optimize for discovery (potentially through the door) before attempting to drop.

Concise refinements to decompose/prune the plan:

- Prioritize exploring beyond the current room via the door (if possible) before repeating a full sweep of the same space.
- Make the “not found” branch more robust than a single sweep (allow a second sweep or door-assisted exploration).

Proposed updated plan tree (concise), keeping actions minimal and deterministic:

- [360] Place a potato on the table (current focus)
  - [360.1 AcquirePotatoIfVisible] If potato is visible now: Take potato
  - [360.2 InventoryCheck] If potato is in inventory: Drop potato on the table
  - [360.3 ExploreDoorAndAdjacentRoom] If the door is closed but unlocked:
    - [360.3.1 OpenDoorAndGoThrough] Go through the door to the adjacent room
    - [360.3.2 SweepAdjacentRoom] Sweep the adjacent room (perimeter first, then interior)
  - [360.4 SweepCurrentRoom] Sweep the current (main) room (perimeter first, then interior) if not already fully swept
  - [360.5 MoveToTableAndPlace] If potato was acquired or found, move to table (0,3) and drop potato
  - [360.6 EndIfNotFoundAfterTwoSweeps] If potato still not found after sweeping adjacent room and current room (two sweeps total), prune this path or loop back to 360.3/360.4 for additional attempts (instead of ending in failure after a single sweep)

Rationale:
- Opening the door and exploring the adjacent room can dramatically reduce search time if the potato is outside the current room.
- If the potato is not in the current room, a second sweep in the current room ensures no spot is missed, without prematurely declaring failure after only one sweep.
- Keeping a single, consistent final step to place the potato (360.5) ensures the goal is achieved as soon as the potato is acquired.

Optional quick guidance (for quick execution):
- If you know the door leads to a space with higher likelihood of potato, perform 360.3.1 and 360.3.2 first, then 360.4, then 360.5.
- If no potato is found after 360.3 and 360.4, use 360.6 to handle repeated sweeps or report failure with a note to continue searching later.

If you’d like, I can tailor the exact action sequence for your current coordinates (you’re at 4,4) and summarize the minimal steps to attempt next.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan is modular and covers both immediate potato acquisition (if visible), inventory handling, and room-to-room exploration, with explicit success/failure branches (two sweeps, etc.). 
- It translates the goal into concrete subgoals (acquire, place, explore, loop) and handles the main contingencies (potato visible, in inventory, or not found after sweeps).
- However, some items are high-level (sweepCurrentRoom, moveToTableAndPlace) and would need to be broken down into primitive moves to execute in this environment.

Decision:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution at a high level. For actual execution, map the high-level steps to primitives:
  - Start with 360.2 SweepCurrentRoom: implement as a perimeter sweep via concrete moves, e.g., if starting from (4,4), follow a perimeter path (4,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,4) -> (4,4).
  - If at any point the potato becomes visible, apply 360.1 AcquirePotato (take) or 360.5 MoveToTableAndPlace (drop on table) as appropriate.
  - If not found after the first sweep, proceed with 360.3 ExploreDoorAndAdjacentRoom and the second sweep (360.4, 360.6) as described.

If you want, I can outline the exact primitive move sequence for the first perimeter sweep from the current position.

[leaf_selector] 362: 360.1.2 — Systematic sweep of the current room to locate the potato, since it’s not visible or in inventory and needs to be found before placement.

[user] 
Perception: {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 4.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 4.0, "y": 4.0}}, "your_inventory": [], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_5", "position": "(0.0,3.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "door", "id": "door_6", "position": "(4.0,4.0)", "state": "closed", "lock_state": "unlocked"}, {"name": "key", "id": "key_4", "position": "(3.0,1.0)"}]}
What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries.

Verified: potato not seen; table at (0.0, 3.0) empty; door closed/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0); key at (3.0, 1.0); you at (4.0, 4.0); inventory empty.

Plan:
360.1.2 Else: Systematic sweep search to cover the room; Strategy: sweep the room (perimeter first, then interior) to maximize new area seen with minimal repeats; This sweep is designed to terminate early if potato becomes visible
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive approach (perimeter sweep, using only allowed moves):

Action sequence (move between adjacent coordinates):

- (4,4) -> (4,3)
- (4,3) -> (4,2)
- (4,2) -> (4,1)
- (4,1) -> (4,0)
- (4,0) -> (3,0)
- (3,0) -> (2,0)
- (2,0) -> (1,0)
- (1,0) -> (0,0)
- (0,0) -> (0,1)
- (0,1) -> (0,2)
- (0,2) -> (0,3)
- (0,3) -> (0,4)
- (0,4) -> (1,4)
- (1,4) -> (2,4)
- (2,4) -> (3,4)
- (3,4) -> (4,4)

This completes a clockwise sweep around the room perimeter. After this, you would proceed with an interior sweep (e.g., (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)) if the potato hasn’t been seen.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,4.0) to (3.0,4.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Action effect: Moved from (4.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 4.0); no potato interaction or placement.

- Current facts:
  - Position: (3.0, 4.0)
  - Table: empty; located at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: at (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the sweep

- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: You moved to a new location along the perimeter; you are at (3.0, 4.0); table remains empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory); this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan ends only when the potato is seen or the search space is exhausted. So far the potato has not been observed, and we have not completed a full perimeter+interior sweep of the 4x4 room. We are at (3,4) on the perimeter, but interior cells remain unchecked. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Plan completed? No. 
Suggested next step (perimeter sweep): continue clockwise along the boundary (e.g., move to (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), etc.), and then proceed to interior positions if needed until the potato is seen or the space is exhausted.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- The plan ends only when the potato is seen or the search space is exhausted. So far the potato has not been observed, and we have not completed a full perimeter+interior sweep of the 4x4 room. We are at (3,4) on the perimeter, but interior cells remain unchecked. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Plan completed? No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The plan is a systematic perimeter-first sweep designed to reveal the potato if it’s in any unseen part of the room. Since potato hasn’t been seen yet, and there may still be unvisited interior areas, continuing the sweep remains the most efficient way to maximize new area seen and satisfy the early-termination goal if the potato appears. No current evidence suggests abandoning the plan.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: The plan is a systematic perimeter-first sweep designed to reveal the potato if it’s in any unseen part of the room. Since potato hasn’t been seen yet, and there may still be unvisited interior areas, continuing the sweep remains the most efficient way to maximize new area seen and satisfy the early-termination goal if the potato appears. No current evidence suggests abandoning the plan.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] - Effect of action:
  - Moved from (3.0,4.0) to (4.0,4.0); no potato interaction or placement.
- Current facts:
  - Position: (4.0, 4.0)
  - Table: (0.0, 3.0), empty
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the sweep

- Which assumptions are right/wrong:
  - Right: Movement along the perimeter executed; you are now at (4.0, 4.0); table empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
Plan 360.1.2 is not finished until either the potato is seen or the entire room (perimeter first, then interior) has been swept. Since the potato remains unseen and the perimeter sweep isn’t complete, the plan is still active.

Decision:
No, the plan is not completed yet.

Brief next steps:
- Continue the perimeter-first clockwise sweep from the current corner (4.0, 4.0), covering the remaining boundary, then proceed to interior cells.
- If the potato becomes visible at any point, terminate early per the plan. If not, complete the sweep and then conclude based on remaining search space.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
Plan 360.1.2 is not finished until either the potato is seen or the entire room (perimeter first, then interior) has been swept. Since the potato remains unseen and the perimeter sweep isn’t complete, the plan is still active.

Decision:
No, the plan is not completed yet.

Brief next steps:
- Continue the perimeter-first clockwise sweep from the current corner (4.0, 4.0), covering the remaining boundary, then proceed to interior cells.
- If the potato becomes visible at any point, terminate early per the plan. If not, complete the sweep and then conclude based on remaining search space.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reasoning:
- Plan 360.1.2 (perimeter-first sweep) is still applicable and aimed at maximizing new area seen with minimal repeats.
- We’re at a corner (4,4) with the perimeter sweep still incomplete; continuing the clockwise sweep will uncover new boundary cells.
- No potato found yet does not invalidate the plan—the interior sweep follows after perimeter coverage.
- Action so far has progressed along the perimeter (moving to new boundary positions), not repetition that stalls progress.

Next step: continue the clockwise perimeter sweep from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 3.0) (and onward along the edge) to extend boundary coverage.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reasoning:
- Plan 360.1.2 (perimeter-first sweep) is still applicable and aimed at maximizing new area seen with minimal repeats.
- We’re at a corner (4,4) with the perimeter sweep still incomplete; continuing the clockwise sweep will uncover new boundary cells.
- No potato found yet does not invalidate the plan—the interior sweep follows after perimeter coverage.
- Action so far has progressed along the perimeter (moving to new boundary positions), not repetition that stalls progress.

Next step: continue the clockwise perimeter sweep from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 3.0) (and onward along the edge) to extend boundary coverage.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- Plan 360.1.2 is a perimeter-first sweep designed to cover the room and terminate early only if the potato is seen. So far, the potato has not been observed and only a portion of the perimeter has been checked. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Decision:
- The plan is not completed. It remains active and should continue the clockwise perimeter sweep.

Suggested next action:
- Move from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 2.0) to continue along the right edge, then (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 0.0), and proceed along the bottom edge to (0.0, 0.0), etc. If you’d like, I can execute the next move.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- Plan 360.1.2 is a perimeter-first sweep designed to cover the room and terminate early only if the potato is seen. So far, the potato has not been observed and only a portion of the perimeter has been checked. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Decision:
- The plan is not completed. It remains active and should continue the clockwise perimeter sweep.

Suggested next action:
- Move from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 2.0) to continue along the right edge, then (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 0.0), and proceed along the bottom edge to (0.0, 0.0), etc. If you’d like, I can execute the next move.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. 

Reasoning: Plan 360.1.2 is a perimeter-first sweep. You are still actively sweeping the right edge (from 4.0,4.0 down to 4.0,3.0 and onward), increasing boundary coverage and avoiding useless repetition. Although the potato hasn’t been seen yet, the approach remains appropriate for systematically locating it.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. 

Reasoning: Plan 360.1.2 is a perimeter-first sweep. You are still actively sweeping the right edge (from 4.0,4.0 down to 4.0,3.0 and onward), increasing boundary coverage and avoiding useless repetition. Although the potato hasn’t been seen yet, the approach remains appropriate for systematically locating it.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of action:
- You moved from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 2.0) along the right edge. No potato interaction or placement occurred.

Current facts:
- Position: (4.0, 2.0)
- Table: empty at (0.0, 3.0)
- Potato: not observed in room or inventory
- Key: (3.0, 1.0)
- Door: closed and unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
- Inventory: empty
- Room size: 4x4
- Perimeter sweep: continuing clockwise along the right edge; boundary coverage advanced (still no potato seen)

Assumptions about the new state:
- Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
- If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
- If still not found, continue the perimeter sweep and track boundary coverage

Right/Wrong:
- Right: Movement executed; you’re at (4.0, 2.0); table empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged; plan to continue sweep.
- Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory). This remains unverified.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries.

Verified facts from perception:
- You are at (4.0, 2.0) in the main room.
- Table at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.
- Door at (4.0, 4.0) is closed and unlocked.
- Key at (3.0, 1.0).
- Potato not observed in room or inventory.
- Inventory empty; room size 4x4.

Relevance for plan node:
- Plan 360.1.2 (perimeter-first sweep) remains applicable; continue clockwise along the right edge from (4.0, 2.0). No potato seen yet; only potato visibility would trigger 356.2.1.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Plan 360.1.2 is not completed yet.

Reasoning:
- The perimeter-first sweep is still in progress. You are currently at (4.0, 2.0) on the right edge, which means a portion of the right edge below you and the entire bottom, left, and top edges remain to be visited.
- The plan only terminates early if the potato becomes visible (356.2.1) or if the search space is exhausted. Neither condition has been met.
- Therefore, you have not finished the perimeter sweep or the subsequent interior search, so the plan is still active.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. Plan 360.1.2 is not completed yet.

Reasoning:
- The perimeter-first sweep is still in progress. You are currently at (4.0, 2.0) on the right edge, which means a portion of the right edge below you and the entire bottom, left, and top edges remain to be visited.
- The plan only terminates early if the potato becomes visible (356.2.1) or if the search space is exhausted. Neither condition has been met.
- Therefore, you have not finished the perimeter sweep or the subsequent interior search, so the plan is still active.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: Plan 360.1.2 is still applicable and is actively progressing the perimeter sweep. We’ve moved to new perimeter locations (advancing boundary coverage) and have not yet seen the potato, which is exactly when the plan continues to sweep and only branches to 356.2.1 if visibility occurs. There’s no repetition or stalled progress.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: Plan 360.1.2 is still applicable and is actively progressing the perimeter sweep. We’ve moved to new perimeter locations (advancing boundary coverage) and have not yet seen the potato, which is exactly when the plan continues to sweep and only branches to 356.2.1 if visibility occurs. There’s no repetition or stalled progress.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- Plan 360.1.2 ends only when the potato is seen or the search space is exhausted. So far the potato hasn’t appeared, and although the perimeter has been swept, the interior cells remain unvisited, so the space isn’t exhausted. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Conclusion: No, the plan is not completed yet.
- Rationale: interior area still needs to be swept; potato visibility could still occur; search space remains.

Next steps (brief):
- Continue the perimeter sweep to finish the boundary, then sweep the interior (cells (1..3,1..3)).
- If potato appears, branch to 356.2.1; if not, continue until all cells are covered or you decide the space is exhausted.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief):
- Plan 360.1.2 ends only when the potato is seen or the search space is exhausted. So far the potato hasn’t appeared, and although the perimeter has been swept, the interior cells remain unvisited, so the space isn’t exhausted. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Conclusion: No, the plan is not completed yet.
- Rationale: interior area still needs to be swept; potato visibility could still occur; search space remains.

Next steps (brief):
- Continue the perimeter sweep to finish the boundary, then sweep the interior (cells (1..3,1..3)).
- If potato appears, branch to 356.2.1; if not, continue until all cells are covered or you decide the space is exhausted.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: Plan 360.1.2 (perimeter-first sweep) is still being followed, and recent actions have advanced boundary coverage along the right edge. Although the potato hasn’t appeared yet, the method is still appropriate: it systematically covers new area with minimal repeats, and it remains designed to terminate early if the potato becomes visible. Continue the clockwise sweep (right edge down to bottom, then left/up as planned) and monitor for visibility signals to trigger 356.2.1.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: Plan 360.1.2 (perimeter-first sweep) is still being followed, and recent actions have advanced boundary coverage along the right edge. Although the potato hasn’t appeared yet, the method is still appropriate: it systematically covers new area with minimal repeats, and it remains designed to terminate early if the potato becomes visible. Continue the clockwise sweep (right edge down to bottom, then left/up as planned) and monitor for visibility signals to trigger 356.2.1.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

content='yes. Rationale: Plan 360.1.2 remains appropriate and is making progress, as the perimeter-first sweep is continuing and advancing along the right edge, expanding explored area.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [373] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short): You cannot execute "Place a potato on the table" yet because there is no potato visible and the inventory is empty. The plan needs a subgoal to locate or acquire the potato first, otherwise the place action cannot be performed.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution. Decompose into locating/acquiring the potato and then placing it.

Recommended decomposition to start execution:
- Preconditions check:
  - If the potato is in inventory, proceed to place it on the table at (0.0, 3.0).
  - If not in inventory, begin locating the potato in the room.

- Subgoal A: Locate/acquire potato
  - Continue search (perimeter sweep or full-room search) until the potato is observed.
  - If the potato is observed in the room:
    - Move to the potato’s location.
    - Pick up the potato into inventory (if your system supports separate “pick up” action).
  - If the potato is not observed after exhaustive search of the room, consider the possibility that it’s not present or not discoverable; terminate with alternate plan if needed.

- Subgoal B: If potato is in inventory
  - Move to the table location (0.0, 3.0).
  - Place the potato on the table.

- Subgoal C: Confirmation
  - Verify that the potato is on the table.
  - If placement fails, reattempt or revise plan.

- Failure branch:
  - If the search space is exhausted and the potato remains unseen and not in inventory, report inability to place the potato and conclude plan outcome.

Notes:
- The current table is empty at (0,3); you are not guaranteed to have the potato yet.
- The plan should explicitly include a pickup step if the potato is elsewhere in the room.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [373] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here are concise refinements to decompose and prune Plan 373 (Place a potato on the table), given current facts (no potato seen, inventory empty, table at (0.0, 3.0)).

Proposed decomposition (two-thread structure)
- 373.1 Locate potato
  - 373.1.1 Inventory check (currently empty)
  - 373.1.2 Continue room search
    - 373.1.2.1 Continue perimeter-first sweep (clockwise along right edge, then bottom, left, top)
    - 373.1.2.2 If potato becomes visible anywhere, branch to 356.2.1
- 373.2 Acquire potato (if found)
  - 373.2.1 If potato is visible or on a reachable surface, pick it up
- 373.3 Move to table and place potato
  - 373.3.1 If potato is in inventory, move to (0.0, 3.0) and place on the table
  - 373.3.2 If potato is visible directly on the table area, pick/place on (0.0, 3.0)
- 373.4 End condition
  - 373.4.1 If full perimeter sweep completed and potato not found, decide next action (e.g., declare not found or request new instructions)

Pruning guidance (when to prune)
- Do not attempt 373.3 (place) until either:
  - 373.2 indicates you have the potato in inventory, or
  - 373.1.2 reveals the potato visibly on/near the table (which would trigger 356.2.1)
- If a full perimeter sweep completes without potato visibility and inventory remains empty, prune the active search branch and move to a higher-level decision (e.g., stop search or switch strategy).

Optional compact version
- 373.1 Locate potato: inventory check + perimeter sweep; if visible -> 356.2.1
- 373.2 Acquire potato: if visible, pick up
- 373.3 Place potato on table: if in inventory or visible on table area
- 373.4 End: if not found after full perimeter sweep, decide next action

These refinements ensure you only attempt to place once you actually have the potato, while continuing the primary search efficiently. If you want, I can generate a concrete step-by-step execution sequence following this refined plan.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [373] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [374] 373.1 Locate potato
  - [375] 373.1.1 Inventory check (currently empty)
  - [376] 373.1.2 Continue room search
  - [377] 373.1.2.1 Perimeter-first sweep: clockwise along right edge, then bottom, left, top
  - [378] 373.1.2.2 If potato becomes visible anywhere, branch to 356.2.1
  - [379] 373.2 Acquire potato (if found)
  - [380] 373.2.1 If potato is visible or on a reachable surface, pick it up
  - [381] 373.3 Move to table and place potato
  - [382] 373.3.1 If potato is in inventory, move to (0.0, 3.0) and place on the table
  - [383] 373.3.2 If potato is visible directly on the table area, pick/place on (0.0, 3.0)
  - [384] 373.4 End condition
  - [385] 373.4.1 If full perimeter sweep completed and potato not found, decide next action (e.g., declare not found or request new instructions)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The goal is broken into concrete, testable steps: locate or acquire the potato, with a perimeter search strategy and clear branches for when the potato is found vs. not found.
- Current state (potato not seen, inventory empty) fits the preconditions for the locating/search steps, and the plan covers both acquisition (if found) and placement on the table.
- End conditions and under-specified outcomes are addressed (end condition if sweep completes; branch to placement if potato is visible or reachable).
- Minor gaps exist (some redundancy between placement steps and explicit end-of-search handling could be tightened), but they do not prevent execution.

Decision:
- Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Suggestions (optional refinements):
- Consolidate 381–383 into a tighter sequence: after acquiring or locating the potato, move to the table and place it in a single branch, with clear precedence (inventory-held potato vs visible-on-table vs other reachable surface).
- Ensure a single, explicit end condition path for “perimeter sweep completed and potato not found” (already present as 385) and a clear instruction for requesting further input if not found. 

Would you like me to start executing from the current state, beginning with 373.1 Locate potato?

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] 374 — Locate potato. Reason: The potato has not been observed and is not in the inventory, so the next step is to locate it before attempting to place it on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries. Potato not observed. Current knowns (for reference): you at (4.0, 1.0) in a 4x4 main room; table (0.0,3.0) empty; door (4.0,4.0) closed/unlocked; key at (3.0,1.0); inventory empty. Plan 373.1 remains applicable to locate the potato.

[user] 
Plan:
373.1 Locate potato
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Simple action: Move to (4.0, 0.0).

Rationale: This continues the clockwise perimeter sweep along the right edge (completing the next segment of Plan 373.1). If the potato is at that edge, you may observe it now and branch to 356.2.1; otherwise, you’ll continue with the remaining perimeter steps.

[user] Plan:
373.1 Locate potato
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: Moved from (4.0, 1.0) to (4.0, 4.0); no potato interaction or placement.

- Current facts after action:
  - Position: (4.0, 4.0)
  - Table: empty at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Key: (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4
  - Plan: 373.1 Locate potato → search the pantry for potatoes (active)

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the pantry search or the perimeter plan as applicable

- Right/Wrong:
  - Right: Movement executed; you are now at (4.0, 4.0); table empty; no potato seen; door/lock state unchanged; plan 373.1 is in effect
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified

[observer] - You observe you are at (4.0, 4.0) in the main room (corner).
- Potato not observed in room or inventory.
- Pantry not observed in this perception.
- Table remains empty at (0.0, 3.0).
- Door is closed and unlocked at (4.0, 4.0).
- Key at (3.0, 1.0); inventory empty.
- Room size: 4x4.

Relevance for plan node:
- Plan 373.1 (locate potato by pantry search) is still applicable, but no pantry has been observed yet, so no pantry search action can be taken. You may need to detect/define pantry location or continue the current perimeter sweep.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: Plan 373.1 requires locating a pantry to search for potatoes. Since no pantry has been observed and the potato remains unseen, the objective of locating the potato hasn’t been achieved, so the plan isn’t complete. The pantry search can’t proceed until a pantry location is identified or observed.

Answer: No, Plan 373.1 is not completed yet. Move to continue the perimeter sweep (360.1.2) to try to locate a pantry location or spot the potato, and then execute pantry search (373.1) if/when a pantry is observed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning: Plan 373.1 requires locating a pantry to search for potatoes. Since no pantry has been observed and the potato remains unseen, the objective of locating the potato hasn’t been achieved, so the plan isn’t complete. The pantry search can’t proceed until a pantry location is identified or observed.

Answer: No, Plan 373.1 is not completed yet. Move to continue the perimeter sweep (360.1.2) to try to locate a pantry location or spot the potato, and then execute pantry search (373.1) if/when a pantry is observed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: Plan 373.1 depends on locating the pantry and then searching it for potatoes. So far, the pantry hasn’t been observed and you haven’t performed a pantry search; recent actions have just moved along the perimeter with no potato visibility, yielding no progress toward the plan step.

Answer: No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: Plan 373.1 depends on locating the pantry and then searching it for potatoes. So far, the pantry hasn’t been observed and you haven’t performed a pantry search; recent actions have just moved along the perimeter with no potato visibility, yielding no progress toward the plan step.

Answer: No.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [386] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- No potato has been found or is in inventory, so there is nothing to place yet. The current plan tree for placing a potato on the table lacks the necessary substeps to locate and obtain the potato. You need explicit subgoals for locating (or acquiring) the potato, then moving to the table and placing it. Without those, executing 386 directly would fail.

Decision:
- The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended decomposition to start execution:
- 386.1 Locate or verify potato presence
  - 386.1.1 Check inventory for a potato; if found, go to 386.3 (move to table) and 386.4 (place).
  - 386.1.2 If not in inventory, look for a potato in the room; if visually observed, branch to 356.2.1 (handle visibility) or to 386.2 if you can pick it up.
  - 386.1.3 If potato is not visible, follow the pantry/search plan (373.1 Locate potato by pantry search) or continue perimeter sweep (Plan 360.1.2) as applicable, until the potato is found or ruled out.
- 386.2 Acquire potato (if found in room)
  - 386.2.1 Move to the potato.
  - 386.2.2 Pick up the potato (add to inventory).
- 386.3 Move to the table
  - 386.3.1 Navigate to the table location (0.0, 3.0).
- 386.4 Place potato on the table
  - 386.4.1 Execute place action to set the potato on the table (0.0, 3.0).
- 386.5 Verify and end
  - 386.5.1 Confirm potato is on the table.
  - 386.5.2 End or proceed to next goal if additional goals exist.

In short: add explicit subgoals for locating/acquiring the potato, then moving to the table and placing it. Only after locating or obtaining the potato should you proceed with 386.3 and 386.4.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan for 386: Place a potato on the table.

Concise decomposition
- 386.1 Check inventory for potato
  - If potato in inventory: 386.1.1 Move to table (0,3); 386.1.2 Place potato on table
- 386.2 If potato not in inventory: locate potato in the room
  - 386.2.1 Continue perimeter search (360.1.2) along the right edge and then clockwise
  - 386.2.2 If potato becomes visible: 356.2.1 branch (pick up or place as appropriate)
  - 386.2.3 If pantry becomes observable: 386.2.3 Inspect pantry for potato
    - 386.2.3.1 If potato found in pantry: pick up to inventory; go to 386.1
- 386.3 If potato is located in room (not in inventory)
  - 386.3.1 Pick up potato (to inventory)
  - 386.3.2 Move to table (0,3)
  - 386.3.3 Place potato on table
- 386.4 If after full search no potato is found
  - 386.4.1 Abort or escalate to alternative plan (e.g., re-run pantry search or broaden search)
- 386.5 Post-placement
  - 386.5.1 Confirm success (goal achieved)

Plan pruning guidance
- Prune: If pantry has not been observed in current perception, treat 386.2.2–386.2.3 as optional branches to be activated only if pantry is observed later. Maintain 373.1 as a separate, fallback plan in case the pantry is discovered later; do not force pantry search active until pantry appears.
- Keep core path active: 386.1 (inventory check) and 386.3 (pickup and place) as the primary flow if the potato is found in inventory or can be picked up.

Notes
- Current state: potato not observed; inventory empty; pantry not observed. The plan assumes potato is either in inventory or locatable via perimeter/pantry exploration. If potato visibility occurs, branch to 356.2.1 as before.

- Keep core path active: 386.1 (inventory check) and 386.3 (pickup and place) as the primary flow if the potato is found in inventory or can be picked up.

Notes
- Current state: potato not observed; inventory empty; pantry not observed. The plan assumes potato is either in inventory or locatable via perimeter/pantry exploration. If potato visibility occurs, branch to 356.2.1 as before.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [386] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [387] 386.1 Check inventory for potato
  - [388] 386.2 Locate potato if not in inventory
  - [389] 386.3 If potato found in room: pick up and place on table
  - [390] 386.4 If potato not found after search: escalate or abort
  - [391] 386.5 Post-placement: confirm success

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution confidently.

Reasoning:
- The current plan assumes a potato exists and can be found, but it does not specify concrete, actionable steps to locate the pantry or to physically retrieve a potato from pantry or other locations.
- There is no explicit branch for what to do if pantry isn’t observed or if no potato is found in the room. This can lead to dead ends or ambiguous actions.
- The plan mixes “locate potato” with “place on table” without detailing the retrieval flow (e.g., move to pantry, inspect shelves, pick up, carry to table).

Recommended refined plan (keeping your numbering style):
- [386] Place a potato on the table.
  - [387] Check inventory for potato
  - [388] If potato not in inventory, locate potato
    - [388.1] If pantry location known: move to pantry and search shelves for potato
    - [388.2] If potato found in pantry: pick up potato
    - [388.3] If potato found in room (not in pantry): pick up potato
  - [389] Place potato on table
  - [390] If potato not found after pantry/search: escalate to alternative search or abort
  - [391] Post-placement: confirm success

This makes the search-and-retrieve flow explicit (inventory → pantry/room search → pick up → place) and handles failure cases, allowing safe, executable action. If you want, I can tailor the steps to fit a specific pantry location or environment you’re assuming.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here are concise refinements to your plan to place a potato on the table, focused on decomposing and pruning nodes before execution.

Concise plan refinements
- Prune
  - Remove 387 (Check inventory for potato) since inventory is known empty.

- Refine 386 and its successors
  - 386 (Place a potato on the table) remains the current focus, but:
    - 386.2 becomes: Locate potato with a full-room search (grid/perimeter sweep) since inventory is empty and pantry has not been observed.
    - 386.2.1 If, during the search, a pantry is observed, branch to plan 373.1 (Locate potato by pantry search).
    - 386.2.2 If potato is found in the room, proceed to 386.3 (pick up and place on the table).
    - 386.2.3 If potato is not found after the full-room search, proceed to 386.4 (escalate or abort; consider re-running perimeter or pantry search).
  - 386.3 If potato is found: pick up the potato and place it on the table.
  - 386.4 If not found after search: escalate to alternative paths (e.g., broaden search strategy or abort per plan rules).
  - 386.5 Post-placement: confirm success once the potato is on the table.

Rationale (brief)
- Inventory is empty and pantry not observed; a full-room search is a robust next step before trying to place anything.
- Keeping pantry and perimeter options as branches allows graceful escalation if the potato remains unfound.
- Post-placement step remains the true final check.

Would you like me to apply these refinements to the plan and proceed with the next action?

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The goal is to place a potato on the table, and the current plan tree cleanly branches into locating the potato (or pantry search) and then placing it if found.
- The current state (potato not seen, pantry not observed, inventory empty) fits starting at 386.2 -> 392 (full-room search). The plan already includes contingencies for pantry (373.1), found-in-room (389), and not-found-after-search (395/386.4) plus post-placement (391). This covers the key possibilities and keeps the path from detection to placement explicit.

Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.
- Next action: execute 392 (386.2 Locate potato with a full-room search / perimeter sweep).
- Branch triggers:
  - If pantry is observed: branch to 373.1 (Locate potato by pantry search).
  - If potato is found in the room: branch to 389 (pick up and place on the table) and then 391 (post-placement).
  - If not found after the full-room search: proceed to 386.4 (escalate/abort) and then 386.5 as needed.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] Leaf task: [392] 386.2 Locate potato with a full-room search (grid/perimeter sweep) since inventory is empty and pantry has not been observed.

Justification: The potato is not in inventory and no pantry has been observed yet, so the appropriate next step is a comprehensive full-room search. This keeps plans aligned with 386.2, with potential branches to 373.1 if a pantry is found (393), or to 394/395 if the potato is found or not.

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive, human-executable action:
- Start the perimeter sweep: from the corner (4,4) move clockwise along the outer edge, checking each cell for the potato in order:
  (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> back to (4,4). After completing the perimeter, begin a grid-based search of the interior (3x3).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,4.0) to (3.3,3.3)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Action effect: Moved from (4.0, 4.0) to (3.3, 3.3); no potato interaction or placement.

- Current facts:
  - Position: (3.3, 3.3)
  - Table: empty at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Pantry: not observed
  - Key: (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4
  - Plan: 386.2 active (full-room grid/perimeter sweep); currently entering a new grid cell (approx. 3.3,3.3)

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the grid sweep, scanning each cell clockwise

- Right/Wrong:
  - Right: Move executed; you are at (3.3, 3.3); no potato seen; plan to continue the grid sweep; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - New observation: You are now at (3.3, 3.3) in the main room (new position).

- No new potato observation in this perception. (Potato status remains unobserved overall.)

- Plan relevance: Plan 386.2 (full-room/grid/perimeter sweep) remains applicable; you’re entering a new grid cell near (3.3,3.3) and will continue the clockwise sweep.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. The plan 386.2 is still in progress.

Reasoning:
- The goal is to locate the potato via a full-room grid/perimeter sweep.
- Potato has not been observed yet, and pantry has not been observed.
- You are currently entering a new grid cell (3.3, 3.3) as part of the grid sweep.
- To complete the plan, you must finish inspecting all grid cells (or find the potato). Since neither condition is met yet, the search is not finished.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. The plan 386.2 is still in progress.

Reasoning:
- The goal is to locate the potato via a full-room grid/perimeter sweep.
- Potato has not been observed yet, and pantry has not been observed.
- You are currently entering a new grid cell (3.3, 3.3) as part of the grid sweep.
- To complete the plan, you must finish inspecting all grid cells (or find the potato). Since neither condition is met yet, the search is not finished.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: Plan 386.2 is an ongoing full-room grid/perimeter sweep. You’ve moved into a new grid cell (3.3, 3.3) as part of the sweep, so you are making progress toward the plan’s goal of locating the potato. The potato remains unseen, but the search space is still being systematically covered, and pantry visibility has not occurred.

Yes, the plan is still promising. Next, continue the grid sweep to the next adjacent cell clockwise.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reason: Plan 386.2 is an ongoing full-room grid/perimeter sweep. You’ve moved into a new grid cell (3.3, 3.3) as part of the sweep, so you are making progress toward the plan’s goal of locating the potato. The potato remains unseen, but the search space is still being systematically covered, and pantry visibility has not occurred.

Yes, the plan is still promising. Next, continue the grid sweep to the next adjacent cell clockwise.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] Effect and status of the action (brief):

- What happened: Moved from (3.3, 3.3) to (3.3, 3.6) along the grid sweep. No potato interaction or placement.
- Current facts:
  - Position: (3.3, 3.6)
  - Table: empty at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Pantry: not observed
  - Key: (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed; unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4
  - Plan: 386.2 active (full-room grid/perimeter sweep); continuing into a new cell
- Assumptions about the new state (unchanged from prior steps, now applicable to new cell):
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the grid sweep, scanning each cell clockwise
- Right/Wrong (brief):
  - Right: Movement executed; you’re in a new grid cell; no potato seen; plan to continue the grid sweep; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now — this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed yet.

Reason:
- Plan 386.2 requires sweeping the full room in a 3x3 grid. We’re currently in a mid-grid cell (e.g., around 3.3, 3.3–3.6) and have not finished scanning all cells clockwise. With no potato seen and pantry not observed, the full grid sweep is still in progress.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed yet.

Reason:
- Plan 386.2 requires sweeping the full room in a 3x3 grid. We’re currently in a mid-grid cell (e.g., around 3.3, 3.3–3.6) and have not finished scanning all cells clockwise. With no potato seen and pantry not observed, the full grid sweep is still in progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: Plan 386.2 (full-room grid/perimeter sweep) is actively being executed, and you’ve just entered a new grid cell (3.3, 3.6). This advances the coverage toward locating the potato (no potato seen yet, but the sweep is progressing). Since we haven't exhausted the search or repeated non-modifying actions, the plan remains promising.

Reasoning: Yes. Reason: Plan 386.2 (full-room grid/perimeter sweep) is actively being executed, and you’ve just entered a new grid cell (3.3, 3.6). This advances the coverage toward locating the potato (no potato seen yet, but the sweep is progressing). Since we haven't exhausted the search or repeated non-modifying actions, the plan remains promising.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to the next grid cell clockwise along the right edge (roughly center at (3.3, 2.0)) and scan the floor and low surfaces for the potato.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: Moved from (3.3,3.6) to (3.3,2.0); no potato interaction or placement.

- Current facts after action:
  - Position: (3.3, 2.0)
  - Table: empty at (0.0, 3.0)
  - Potato: not observed in room or inventory
  - Pantry: not observed
  - Key: (3.0, 1.0)
  - Door: closed/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Inventory: empty
  - Room size: 4x4
  - Plan: 386.2 active (full-room grid/perimeter sweep); continuing the grid sweep to the next cell

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - Potato exists somewhere in the room or inventory and can be placed on the table
  - If potato becomes visible, branch to 356.2.1
  - If still not found, continue the grid sweep, scanning each cell clockwise

- Right/Wrong:
  - Right: Movement executed; you’re at (3.3, 2.0); no potato seen; plan to continue the grid sweep; door/lock state unchanged.
  - Wrong/Unverified: The potato is guaranteed to be available to place right now (not observed and not in inventory) — this remains unverified.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: Plan 386.2 aims to cover all 9 cells of a 3x3 grid through a full-room sweep. So far only a subset of cells has been visited and no potato found, so the plan is still in progress and not completed.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed yet. Continue the grid sweep, visiting the remaining cells clockwise, scanning floor and low surfaces. If the potato becomes visible at any point, branch to 356.2.1; if all 9 cells are searched without finding the potato, the search space is exhausted and you can conclude accordingly.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning: Plan 386.2 aims to cover all 9 cells of a 3x3 grid through a full-room sweep. So far only a subset of cells has been visited and no potato found, so the plan is still in progress and not completed.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed yet. Continue the grid sweep, visiting the remaining cells clockwise, scanning floor and low surfaces. If the potato becomes visible at any point, branch to 356.2.1; if all 9 cells are searched without finding the potato, the search space is exhausted and you can conclude accordingly.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reasoning:
- We are actively progressing through new grid cells under plan 386.2 (grid/perimeter sweep) and have not yet exhausted the search.
- Pantry has not been observed, but plan 386.2 is still the appropriate method for a full-room sweep; plan 373.1 (pantry search) only becomes primary if a pantry is detected.
- Since the potato could still be in an unsearched cell, continuing the grid sweep remains a valid approach and keeps the search progressing toward a discovery or a full coverage conclusion.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reasoning:
- We are actively progressing through new grid cells under plan 386.2 (grid/perimeter sweep) and have not yet exhausted the search.
- Pantry has not been observed, but plan 386.2 is still the appropriate method for a full-room sweep; plan 373.1 (pantry search) only becomes primary if a pantry is detected.
- Since the potato could still be in an unsearched cell, continuing the grid sweep remains a valid approach and keeps the search progressing toward a discovery or a full coverage conclusion.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Next action: Move to the next grid cell clockwise in the 3x3 grid from your current position (near 3.3,2.0) and perform a full floor/low-surface sweep in that cell.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
