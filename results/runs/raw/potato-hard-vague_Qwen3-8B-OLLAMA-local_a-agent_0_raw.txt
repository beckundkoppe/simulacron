Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Attempted to interact with door_8 but failed due to distance.  
- No potato was present in the environment.  

**Facts:**  
- No potato is visible or mentioned in the observation.  
- The door is closed but unlocked, requiring proximity to interact.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Assumed the potato might be inside the box (but it contains only a diamond).  
- Assumed the potato could be retrieved from another location (but no such object exists).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- The potato is not present in the environment.  
- The door’s proximity issue prevents interaction without movement.  

**Conclusion:**  
The action failed because the potato was absent, and the door could not be interacted with from the current position.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to (0,4) and dropped diamond_10 on table_4 (already containing diamond_5).  

**Facts:**  
- Table_4 contains 1 diamond (diamond_5).  
- Box_6 is empty.  
- Door_8 is open, leading to a chamber with no potato.  
- No potato exists in the environment.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Assumed the potato might be in the chest/chamber (but it isn’t).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- All potato-location assumptions were incorrect.  
- The task cannot be completed due to the potato’s absence.  

**Conclusion:**  
The potato is absent; the table has no potato. Task remains impossible.

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Assumed chest_12 might contain the potato (proven wrong).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- All potato-location assumptions were incorrect.  

**Conclusion:**  
The potato is absent; the task remains impossible.

1. Take potato_9 from chest_12.  
2. Move to table_4.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Collected** potato_9 from chest_12 (now empty).  
- **Moved** to table_4 (0,4) and **dropped** potato_9 on the table.  

**Facts:**  
- Chest_12 is **open** and **empty** (potato_9 removed).  
- Table_4 now contains **1 potato** (potato_9).  
- No other potatoes exist in the environment.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Assumed the chest contained the potato (proven **correct**).  
- Assumed the table was accessible for placement (proven **correct**).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- Previous assumptions about the potato’s absence (proven **wrong**).  

**Conclusion:**  
The potato was in the chest, retrieved, and placed on the table. Task completed.
