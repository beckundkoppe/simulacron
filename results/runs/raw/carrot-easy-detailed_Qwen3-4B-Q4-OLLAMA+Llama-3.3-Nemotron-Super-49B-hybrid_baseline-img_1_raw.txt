Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move 0.5 units right.

(Note: This action sequence assumes a grid-based or discrete movement system, which is common in text-based adventure games. If the environment allows continuous movement, the instruction would be adjusted accordingly.)

**Rationale for the chosen action:**
1. **Proximity**: The table is at `(1.0, 4.0)`, and you're at `(0.5, 0.5)`. Moving closer reduces the number of actions needed to reach the table.
2. **Minimality**: Moving only in one direction (`x` axis) first simplifies the path and minimizes immediate actions, as moving diagonally or in multiple directions simultaneously isn't specified as an option.
3. **Goal Alignment**: The ultimate goal is to place the carrot on the table. This action brings you closer to achieving that.

**Next Expected Action (after this one)**:
- Move up 3.5 units to reach the table's position `(1.0, 4.0)`.

**Sequence So Far for Goal Achievement**:
1. **Move Right 0.5** (to `(1.0, 0.5)`) *<- THIS ACTION*
2. **Move Up 3.5** (to `(1.0, 4.0)`)
3. **Drop Carrot**

Please confirm or adjust based on movement system specifics (discrete vs. continuous).

[action_imaginator] **Next Action:**  
`move y: 4.0` (Move upwards along Y-axis to align with table's Y-position)  

**Rationale:** To place the carrot on the table, you first need to be adjacent or at the table's position. Currently, you share the same X-coordinate (1.0) with the table but not the Y-coordinate. Moving to `y: 4.0` puts you in position to interact with the table directly.

**Sequence So Far & Next Steps:**
1. **Moved x: 0.5 → 1.0** (Completed)
2. **Move y: 0.5 → 4.0** (Recommended Next Action)
3. **Drop carrot** (Subsequent Action, after being at table's position)
