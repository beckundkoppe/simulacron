Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to chest_5
[ACTION EXECUTED] opened chest_5
[ACTION FAILURE] cucumber_3 is too far away to interact. Hint: Move closer to the object before interacting.
[ACTION FAILURE] potato_6 is too far away to interact. Hint: Move closer to the object before interacting.
[ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (2.0,2.0) to chest_5
[ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (2.0,2.0) to cucumber_3
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
[ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3.5,1.5) to chest_5
[ACTION EXECUTED] dropped cucumber_3 into chest_5

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**
- Successfully moved to and opened chest_5
- Collected cucumber_3 from cucumber_3
- Dropped cucumber_3 into chest_5
- Failed to interact with potato_6 due to distance

**Assumptions made:**
- Chest_5 was accessible and could be opened
- cucumber_3 was within reach after moving to its location
- potato_6 was accessible (this proved wrong)

**What proved right:**
- Movement and interaction with chest_5 worked as expected
- Collection and dropping of cucumber_3 was successful

**What proved wrong:**
- Assumed potato_6 was reachable - it wasn't, showing distance limitations weren't properly assessed before attempting interaction

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observations:**
- cucumber_3 is confirmed at position (2.0,2.0) inside open chest_5
- table_4 is at position (3.5,0.5) - 1.5 units away from current position (2.0,2.0)
- potato_6 is at position (0.5,1.5) - 1.5 units away from current position (2.0,2.0)

**Relevance for goal:**
- cucumber_3 is reachable and can be collected
- table_4 is reachable and can be used for placing the cucumber
- potato_6 is reachable but not relevant to current goal

**Verification:**
- Facts match perception: chest_5 is open and contains cucumber_3
- Facts match perception: table_4 exists at (3.5,0.5) and is empty
- Facts match perception: potato_6 exists at (0.5,1.5)

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to cucumber_3 at (2.0,2.0) and pick it up, then move to table_4 at (3.5,0.5) and place it there.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
