[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**

**Facts:**
- Agent moved from (0.75,0.75) to table_2
- Agent collected onion_3 from table_2

**Assumptions about new state:**
- Onion_3 was originally on table_2
- Agent's new position is table_2
- Agent now possesses onion_3

**Assumptions verified:**
- ✅ Agent successfully moved to table_2
- ✅ Agent collected onion_3 (assumption proved right)

**Assumptions that were made:**
- Agent was at (0.75,0.75) before moving
- Onion_3 existed on table_2
- Agent could collect onion_3 from table_2

**Verification:**
- The action sequence was executed successfully
- No contradictions in the state changes
- All assumptions about the action outcomes were correct

- The table I'm currently at (table_2) is now empty, which means I collected the onion from it
- The door leading to the hallway (door_15) is accessible and unlocked
- The compost area is in the garden, which I need to reach through the main door

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**

**Facts:**
- Agent moved from mudroom (2,1) to garden (2,0)
- Agent went through door_20 into garden
- Agent moved from garden (2,0) to compost area (1,1)
- Agent moved from compost area (1,1) to garden (1,0)
- Agent moved from garden (1,0) to door_20 (1,0)
- Agent went through door_20 into mudroom

**Assumptions verified:**
- ✅ Agent successfully transitioned between mudroom and garden
- ✅ Door_20 was accessible and functional
- ✅ Agent reached compost area (assumption proved right)

**Assumptions that were made:**
- Agent was at mudroom position before moving to garden
- Door_20 was unlocked and open (verified by successful passage)
- Compost area existed and was reachable

**Verification:**
- Action sequence executed successfully
- No contradictions in state changes
- All assumptions about action outcomes were correct

[observer] **Observations:**
- I am in the mudroom at position (2, 0)
- I am holding onion_3
- Door_20 is open and unlocked at position (2, 1)
- Door_19 is open and unlocked at position (0, 1)

**Relevant for goal:**
- I am in the mudroom (successor to hallway)
- I still have the onion
- Both doors are open and accessible

**New discoveries:**
- I am in the mudroom
- I have the onion
- Both doors are open and unlocked (no need to open them)
