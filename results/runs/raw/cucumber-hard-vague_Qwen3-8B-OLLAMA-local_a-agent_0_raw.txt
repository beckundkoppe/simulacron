[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber is collected (now in agent's inventory).  
- Table remains empty and accessible.  

**Assumptions about new state:**  
- Cucumber is placed on the table (incorrect assumption).  

**Proven wrong assumptions:**  
- The cucumber was not placed on the table; it was only collected.  

**Correct state:**  
- Cucumber is in the agent's inventory. Next step: move to the table and drop it.
