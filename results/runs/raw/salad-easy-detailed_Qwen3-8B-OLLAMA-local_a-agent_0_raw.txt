[observer] Spinach objects are positioned along the same y-coordinate (y=1) as the box (at x=4, y=1), allowing direct rightward movement to place them. Lettuce objects are aligned along y=3, matching the shelf's y-coordinate (at x=4, y=3), enabling similar direct placement. All spinach and lettuce are within the room's bounds.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to spinach_6 (y=1), picked it up.  
- Moved to box location (x=4, y=1).  

**Facts:**  
- Spinach_6 is now at the box's position (x=4, y=1).  
- The spinach is in the agent's inventory.  

**Assumptions about the new state:**  
- The spinach is placed into the box (assumed via proximity).  

**Proven assumptions:**  
- The spinach is at the box's location (correct).  
- The spinach is not yet placed (assumption was wrong; placement requires an explicit "place" action).  

**Corrected state:**  
- Spinach_6 is held by the agent at (4,1), not yet placed.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Dropped spinach_6 into box_3.  

**Facts:**  
- Spinach_6 is now in the box (placed).  
- Agent is at (4.0, 1.0).  

**Assumptions about the new state:**  
- Other spinach (spinach_5, spinach_7) and all lettuce (lettuce_8–10) remain in their original positions.  
- Shelf_4 at (4.0, 3.0) is unoccupied.  

**Proven assumptions:**  
- Spinach_6 is placed in the box (correct).  
- Other items are still in their positions (correct).  

**Wrong assumptions:**  
- Previous assumption that proximity alone placed spinach (proven wrong; required explicit "place" action).  

**Next steps:**  
- Move to lettuce positions (y=3), pick up each lettuce, move to shelf_4 (x=4, y=3), and drop them.
