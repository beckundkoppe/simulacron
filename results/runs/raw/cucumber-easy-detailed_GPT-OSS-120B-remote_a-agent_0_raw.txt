[reflector] **Facts after the move**

- **Human position:** now at (3.5, 1.5) – the exact location of `cucumber_3`.
- **Inventory:** still empty (no objects have been taken yet).
- **Cucumber `cucumber_3`:** still located at (3.5, 1.5) and has not been moved or altered.
- **Table `table_4`:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5), still empty.
- **Environment:** no obstacles or doors blocked the path; the move succeeded.

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. *The path from (0, 0) to (3.5, 1.5) is clear.* – **proved correct** (the move completed without error).
2. *Moving does not affect other objects.* – **proved correct** (cucumber and table remain where they were).
3. *The human can occupy the same tile as the cucumber before picking it up.* – **proved correct** (the human is now standing on the cucumber’s tile).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the pick‑up**

- **Human position:** (3.5, 1.5) – unchanged.  
- **Inventory:** now contains `cucumber_3`.  
- **Cucumber `cucumber_3`:** no longer on the floor; it is being held.  
- **Table `table_4`:** still at (3.5, 0.5) and empty.  

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. *The human can hold the cucumber while staying on its tile.* – **proved correct** (the cucumber moved to inventory).  
2. *Removing the cucumber does not affect other objects.* – **proved correct** (the table remains unchanged).  
3. *The human’s position does not change when taking an object.* – **proved correct** (still at 3.5, 1.5).  

All assumptions made before the pick‑up held true.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

- **Human position:** (3.5, 0.5) – the exact location of `table_4`.

2. *The tile (3.5, 0.5) is reachable and not blocked.* – proved correct (the move succeeded).  
3. *Occupying the same tile as the table does not automatically place the held object on the table.* – proved correct (the table is still empty).
