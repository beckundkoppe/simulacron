[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- The cucumber remains at (3.5, 1.5) (it was not picked up).  
- The table stays at (3.5, 0.5) and remains empty.

- *Assumption:* The human is now at the cucumber’s location.  
  - **Result:** Correct.  
- *Assumption:* No other state changes (e.g., cucumber not moved, table unchanged).  
  - **Result:** Correct.  

No other assumptions were made.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Cucumber is still at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and remains empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. The human has moved to the cucumber’s location.  
2. No other state changes occurred (cucumber not picked up, table unchanged).

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong**

- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the human is indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – the cucumber stayed where it was and the table stayed empty.  

The intended goal (pick up the cucumber and place it on the table) was not achieved because the cucumber was not picked up.
