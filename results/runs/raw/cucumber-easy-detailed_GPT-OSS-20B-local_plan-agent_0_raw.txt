[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

- The human agent is now at coordinates **(3.5, 1.5)**.  
- No objects were taken, dropped, or interacted with.  
- The cucumber remains wherever it was before (unknown location).  
- The table remains unchanged.

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. The path from (0, 0) to (3.5, 1.5) was clear of obstacles.  
2. The cucumber was located at (3.5, 1.5).  
3. The cucumber was reachable from that position.

**Which assumptions held?**

- **Assumption 1** – *Path clear* – proved **true**; the move succeeded.  

**Which assumptions failed?**

- **Assumption 2** – *Cucumber at (3.5, 1.5)* – proved **false**; the cucumber was not found.  
- **Assumption 3** – *Cucumber reachable* – also false, since the cucumber was not present at the target location.  

The goal “find the cucumber, pick it up, and place it on the table” remains unmet.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Item | Final location / state |
|------|------------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) – standing on the table |
| Cucumber | On the table at (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) – now occupied by the cucumber |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The cucumber was reachable from that position.  
3. The table at (3.5, 0.5) was empty.

**Which assumptions held?**

- **Assumption 1** – *Cucumber at (3.5, 1.5)* – **true**.  
- **Assumption 2** – *Cucumber reachable* – **true**.  
- **Assumption 3** – *Table empty* – **false** (the cucumber is now on the table).

Thus the goal “find the cucumber, pick it up, and place it on the table” is satisfied.
