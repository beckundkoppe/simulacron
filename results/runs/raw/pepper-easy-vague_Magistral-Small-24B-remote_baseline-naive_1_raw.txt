content='I think i should first drop the pepper I currently hold onto the table, so other peppers can be collected after moving closer to them. The goal is to place all peppers on the table.\n\nFirst action: move towards the table and drop the pepper.\n\nBut before that i need to pick up another pepper. So, I need to collect pepper_5 from its current location first.\n\nBut before that, I need to be close enough to pepper_5 to collect it.\n\nSo steps:\n1. Move to position of pepper_5\n2. Collect pepper_5.\n3. Move to table and drop pepper_4 and pepper_5.\n4. Now move closer to pepper_3 (the remaining one)\n5. Collect Pepper_3.\n6. Move back to the table and drop it.\n\nBut the problem is that I can only provide next best action. So i should perform actions in a sequence which would lead to all peppers on the table.\n\nSo first, i need to move towards pepper_5 since it\'s closest to me from all remaining peppers except pepper_4 which is already collected.\nBut pepper_4 is already in inventory and I can drop it directly to the table. Maybe it\'s better to head straight to the table to drop pepper_4 first.\n\nBut then, pepper_3 and pepper_5 are both near the table. So strategy could be:\n1. take pepper_id=pepper_4 (already done) but no it was collected.\nWait current state says pepper_4 is in inventory.\n\nSo:\n1. move towards table and drop pepper_4 on the table\n2. then with empty hands, pick up a closer pepper (pepper_3 or pepper_5)\nLet\'s say I go for pepper_3 since its at same distance as pepper_5 but maybe it doesn\'t matter.\n\nBut then I would need to come back to table to drop pepper_3 and then again go to pepper_5... seems inefficient. Maybe better to pick up pepper_3 first (since its at 3.5,1.5 and I am at 2.75,0.9 which is approximately same distance as pepper_5 but if i move directly to table, I can drop pepper_4 and then continue to collect others.\n\nBut maybe better to go for the farthest first since others are closer together.\n\nLet me try:\n1. move to (3.5, 1.0) (position of pepper_5)\nBut I already collected pepper_4 which is at 3.0,1.5 and moved from initial position to (2.75,0.9). Wait no, the last action was collecting pepper_4 so my position should be near pepper_4 which is at (3.0,1.5).\n\nWait let\'s see:\n\nInitial position: (0.0, 0.0)\nAfter moving to (2.75, 0.9): this is close enough to collect pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5).\nThen collected pepper_4.\nNow need to move towards remaining peppers.\n\nRemaining peppers: pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5), pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0)\nTable is at (3.5,0.5)\n\nCurrent position after collecting pepper_4 should still be near (3.0,1.5) since that\'s where pepper_4 was collected from.\n\nSo next best action could be to move towards table first and drop pepper_4, as it\'s on the way to pick up other peppers. Let me calculate:\n\nCurrent position: approximately (3.0,1.5)\nTable is at (3.5, 0.5). To reach table, need to go down in y direction.\n\nPeppers are:\npepper_3: (3.5,1.5) - this is right next to table but at the same height as me\npepper_5: (3.5,1.0) - slightly below\n\nIf I move directly to table (3.5, 0.5), I can drop pepper_4 there.\nThen from table, I can go up in y direction to collect pepper_3 and pepper_5. Pepper_3 is at same height as current position\'s y-coordinate (1.5), while pepper_5 is lower (y=1.0).\n\nSo next best action: move towards table to drop pepper_4.\n\nBut before that, to get current state correct, the initial movement was from (0.0,0.0) to (2.75,0.9). Then collected pepper_4 at position (3.0, 1.5).\n\nHmm (2.75,0.9) is not near (3.0,1.5). Wait how was I able to collect pepper_4? The initial movement must have been closer.\n\nWait looking back:\n\nInitial perception: pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5)\nAction 1: moved from (0.0,0.0) to (2.75,0.9). Wait this seems not close enough to collect pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5).\n\nWait maybe the movement was directly to (3.0,1.5). But the action executed shows moving to (2.75,0.9), which is approximately near but not exactly there.\n\nBut the next action says collected pepper_4, so perhaps the movement was close enough for collection by game mechanics.\n\nSo current position after collecting pepper_4 should still be around (2.75, 0.9) or possibly at (3.0,1.5). Assuming it\'s near (3.0,1.5), let\'s plan next move:\n\nWith pepper_4 in inventory, next best is to head towards the table at (3.5,0.5) to drop it.\n\nSo action: move_to_position with x=3.5, y=0.5\n\nBut then I could directly drop pepper_4 on table while there.\n\nWait, but to maximize effiency, I should collect peppers on my way or drop first. Since table is near peppers (they are at 3.5,1.5 and 3.5,1.0), after dropping pepper_4, I can move up in y direction and pick up other peppers since they are vertically aligned.\n\nSo next action sequence:\n1. move_to_position (3.5, 0.5) - reach table\n2. drop_to table from inventory item pepper_4\nNow at table with no items.\nNow need to collect remaining two peppers which are both at x=3.5 but different y positions: pepper_5 at y=1.0 and pepper_3 at y=1.5.\n\nNext action could be moving towards pepper_5 (at 3.5,1.0) first since it\'s closer in y direction from table at (3.5,0.5).\nThen after collecting pepper_5, move up to pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5), collect it.\nThen back down to table at (3.5,0.5) to drop both.\n\nSo next action: move_to_position y=1.0 (same x as current position which is 3.5). So just set y=1.0 to reach pepper_5.\n\nBut since i can only execute one action next, and I am currently near the table after dropping pepper_4, with no items in inventory, next best action is to move towards one of the remaining peppers, say pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0).\n\nSo next action: move_to_position x=3.5 y=1.0\n\nBut looking for most efficient path, perhaps better to go directly to pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5), since it\'s the farthest and then on way back collect pepper_5.\n\nAlternatively since i\'m near table at (3.5,0.5), I can move in straight line up y-axis:\n- first pass pepper_5 at y=1.0\n- then reach pepper_3 at y=1.5\n\nSo next action: move to pepper_3 directly (as it\'s higher) while on the way i pass pepper_5 but won\'t be able to collect it before reaching pepper_3.\n\nBut since I can only collect an item when I am at its position, I would need to collect pepper_5 first if I go upwards then downwards. Or better, move upwards towards pepper_5 (since it\'s first on the path up), then after collecting pepper_5, continue up to pepper_3.\n\nBut that\'s two steps of moving and collecting while i can only specify next action as move_to.\n\nGiven that, perhaps best is to plan a sequence where each step brings me closer to goal with minimal actions.\n\nCurrent items in inventory: none (after dropping pepper_4 on table)\nRemaining peppers: pepper_3 at 3.5,1.5 and pepper_5 at 3.5,1.0\nCurrent position: near table at (3.5,0.5)\n\nNext action should be to start collecting remaining peppers with minimal movement.\n\nOption 1: move up in y direction to collect pepper_5 first:\n- move_to_position x=3.5 y=1.0\nThen next step would be to possibly move down the same path to table but that\'s redundant rather go further up to pepper_3.\nBut after collecting pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0), I need to move to pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5) so additional movement required.\n\nOption 2: move directly to pepper_3 at y=1.5\nThen next would need to go back down for pepper_5\n\nBoth options require 2 collect actions with some pathing in between but since we can only specify one action ahead, perhaps it\'s best to choose the first option: move towards pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0) to start collecting upwards.\n\nSo next action is:\nmove_to_position x=3.5 y=1.0\n\nThen next planned would be collect pepper_5 there, then move up to 1.5 to collect pepper_3.\n\nBut since we need to provide only the immediate next action based on current state and long term goal, which is to place all peppers on table:\n\nCurrent inventory: empty (since pepper_4 was dropped)\nRemaining items: pepper_3 and pepper_5 at near positions\n\nBest immediate next action is likely to move towards one of them. Since pepper_5 is closer in y direction from current position assumed at table (or nearby), so:\n\nNext action:\nmove_to_position {\n  "x": 3.5,\n  "y": 1.0\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial movement was to (2.75, 0.9) and state after collecting pepper_4 is:\nposition: roughly near pepper_4 which was at (3.0, 1.5)\nobjects left to collect: pepper_3(3.5,1.5), pepper_5(3.5,1.0)\n\nWait if I already collected pepper_4 from (3.0,1.5), but initial position moved to was (2.75,0.9) which is not close enough to collect (assuming collection requires being at the exact position).\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the "move" was close enough for collection in game\'s terms, so maybe current position after collecting is at pepper_4\'s original location: (3.0, 1.5).\n\nAssuming current position is at or near (3.0,1.5), while holding pepper_4.\n\nNow as next action, I should drop pepper_4 onto table before collecting others to maintain efficiency.\n\nSo first action after this would be:\n1. move towards table: x=3.5 y=0.5\nBut with pepper_4 in inventory and position near (3.0,1.5), moving directly to table by adjusting both coordinates might not be the best.\n\nAlternatively since I\'m at (3.0, 1.5) which shares same row as pepper_5(x=3.5,y=1.5) wait no pepper_5 is at y=1.0 and pepper_3 is at y=1.5 so:\n\nIf current position is same as pepper_3\'s position (3.5,1.5), then that would mean I didn\'t move correctly earlier because initial position was moved to (2.75,0.9) which isn\'t close to pepper_4.\n\nThis seems there might be confusion in position tracking.\n\nAssuming that the \'move_to_position\' action successfully moves the player to those coordinates, and at (2.75,0.9), I could collect pepper_4 from (3.0,1.5). This suggests that collection is possible when within a certain radius rather than exactly at coordinates. Similarly for previous actions.\n\nGiven that uncertainty in exact position mechanics, perhaps it\'s better to assume that collection happens once the player is near enough, and next positions can be considered as last known accurate positions after each action.\n\nSo let\'s re-express with that:\nInitial state:\n- Position: (0, 0)\n- Inventory: empty\n- Peppers on field: pepper_4(3.0,1.5), pepper_3(3.5,1.5), pepper_5(3.5,1.0)\n\naction1 : move_to_position(2.75, 0.9) - this seems to be a position from which pepper_4 can be collected\naction2: collect pepper_4 (inventory now has pepper_4)\nCurrent assumed position remains near pepper_4\'s original position after collection; for simplicity assume at (3.0,1.5)\n\ntable is at (3.5, 0.5), remaining peppers:\npepper_3(3.5,1.5) - on same y as current position but different x\npepper_5(3.5,1.0) - one unit below y=1.5\n\nNext best action to progress towards goal of all peppers on table:\n- with pepper_4 in inventory, move towards table while en-route to remaining peppers.\nIf I move directly towards table from (3.0,1.5), it requires moving diagonally down-right, which might not align well for collecting others.\n\nAlternative: head vertically upwards or downwards first since current and remaining items share same x coordinate in future paths.\nBut actually pepper_3 is at y=1.5 - where we roughly are (assuming pos after collect is nearby)\nWait if current position is same as pepper_3\'s position, then I can directly collect pepper_3 without moving.\n\nBut the initial move was to (2.75,0.9), collected from there, so current position may not be exactly at pepper_3 or pepper_4.\n\nThis path confusion suggests that perhaps in planning next action, we should rely only on known positions and not assume intermediate states unless explicitly tracked in state representations.\n\nGiven initial state updates after actions:\nAfter move to (2.75,0.9), collected pepper_4 - now position may be assumed same as pepper_4\'s origin at (3.0,1.5), inventory has pepper_4\n\nNext action options with goal of moving peppers to table:\nA) Move immediately towards table to drop pepper_4 first.\n   path: from estimated position (3.0,1.5) -> towards (3.5, 0.5)\n   while moving to table could collect pepper_3 on the way if positions align\n   but likely better to reach table safely with pepper_4 before collecting others\n\nThus next best action is move_to_position(x=3.5 y=0.5), then drop pepper_4 at table.\n\nFollowing that, with empty inventory and now at table position (3.5,0.5), remaining peppers are:\npepper_3(3.5,1.5) - directly above at same x\npepper_5(3.5,1.0) - halfway up at same x\n\nSo following action would be collect pepper_5 first (shorter upward distance), then move up to collect pepper_3.\n\nBut again only next action is requested so:\n\nNext planned action given current state (assuming pos ~3.0,1.5 holding pepper_4): move_to table for dropping.\n\nTherefore output:\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "position": {"x": 3.5, "y": 0.5}\n}\n```\n\nBut wait to optimize and considering that after moving to table at (3.5, 0.5) with pepper_4, we\'d next need to head up to collect peppers in order. But perhaps better path is:\n1. From current near (3.0,1.5), move directly towards pepper_5 (since it\'s on the way from table to pepper_3 if coming from below)\n   No: both remaining peppers have x=3.5 so first move horizontally to x=3.5 regardless of y.\n\nWait no: current estimated position is ~ (3.0,1.5) (same as last collected item\'s pos)\nSo next action can be a diagonal move towards table at (3.5, 0.5), but since we have to input exact x,y that becomes the target point until arrival.\n\nAlternative is that since pepper_4 is in inventory and we\'re roughly at same location where it was found (now defunct) which coincidentally shares y=1.5 with pepper_3, maybe better to:\n- first drop pepper_4 into empty space near intended path then collect others\n\nBut with no more info on position after collection, will proceed with initial plan of heading direct to table to offload held pepper first.\n\nFinal next action proposed:\n\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "position": {"x": 3.5, "y": 1.0}\n}\n\nWait why y=1.0? That\'s pepper_5\'s position but not on path from (3.0,1.5) to table(3.5,0.5).\n\nCorrect next move should be towards table: adjust x from ~3.0 to target 3.5, and y from ~1.5 down to 0.5. But exact x,y input would take linear path straight to those coords.\n\nPerhaps more efficient movement is possible by moving horizontally first to x=3.5 then vertically adjusting y to table\'s level after offloading. So split move: first align x coordinate to match others\' path (since all remainders have same x), then adjust y.\n\nNext action:\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "position": {"x": 3.5, "y": 1.0}\n}\n```\nThis sets the player on the correct horizontal plane as future target peppers while making next vertical adjustment shorter for both remaining pepper positions.\nAfter reaching this position (also coincidentally at pepper_5\'s location), we can immediately collect it if range allows or plan next step accordingly.\n\n### Final Next Action:\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "position": {"x": 3.5, "y": 1.0}\n}\n```\nThis optimizes for both pepper collection order and alignment towards remaining objectives.\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4129, 'prompt_tokens': 2122, 'total_tokens': 6251, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-270', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019aff20-0c89-77e3-8be8-ed1c5fdfc6be-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2122, 'output_tokens': 4129, 'total_tokens': 6251, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='The goal is not specified, so I can\'t provide the best next action to perform. Please specify the goal.\n\n### Goal: Collect all peppers\n\nGiven that there are three peppers in the perception:\n- pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5)\n- pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0)\n\nI currently have pepper_4 in my inventory. The table is empty, so I need to pick up the other two peppers from the floor near the table.\n\n### Current Position\nCurrent position is next to the table: (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Steps:\n1. The peppers are located at (3.5, 1.0) and (3.5, 1.5).\n2. I can move to these positions and pick up each pepper.\n\nBut first, I need to check the closest pepper or if there is any specific goal. Since the goal is to collect all peppers:\n- Move to (3.5, 1.0) to pick up pepper_5\n- Then move to (3.5, 1.5) to pick up pepper_3\n\nBut since I am already at the table (same x-coordinate), moving vertically should be easier.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- First action: Move to position (3.5, 1.0) and then take pepper_5 from the floor.\n- Second action: Move to position (3.5, 1.5) and then take pepper_3 from the floor.\n\nBut before moving, I need to confirm if the table is blocking the path or not. From current location at (3.5, 0.5), I\'m at the base of the table, and peppers are above me:\n- pepper_5: (3.5,1.0)\n- pepper_3: (3.5,1.5)\n\nAssuming that the human can move freely around objects without obstruction (unless specified), I can proceed to these positions directly.\n\nHowever, it\'s possible that the human needs to walk around the table if it blocks movement. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, we assume free movement in 2D space without obstacles.\n\nBut in room-based environments with tables, it\'s common that the human must walk around objects rather than through them. So perhaps moving horizontally away from the table first (changing x position) and then approaching from another side to reach higher y positions.\n\nBut the initial data says I am at (2.75,0.9), but after the action "moved from (2.75,0.9) to table_6", it seems my new position is the table\'s position: (3.5, 0.5).\n\nFrom here:\n\n- pepper_5 is at (3.5,1.0)\n- pepper_3 is at (3.5,1.5)\n\nAssuming I can move while staying adjacent to the table, I can try moving up along y-axis.\n\nBut if movement is constrained to grid-like steps or cannot overlap with objects, it\'s unclear without more context.\n\nGiven minimal info, simplest assumption: can move directly to target y position while keeping x fixed (i.e. walk straight upwards in front of the table).\n\nThus:\n\n1. move to (3.5, 1.0)\n - take pepper_5 from FLOOR\n2. move to (3.5, 1.5)\n - take pepper_3 from FLOOR\n\nBut wait: what is the goal? The problem initially had "None" for the goal.\n\nGiven that no specific task is provided in the initial input, perhaps the system expects me to define a task after seeing the state - but this seems unlikely.\n\nLooking back at the original task description:\n\n"You control a human in a 2D room-based environment. The human agent can move, take and drop objects, and interact with objects (open, close, lock, unlock, go through or look through doors). Always choose the minimal action sequence that achieves the requested goal and nothing else."\n\nBut no specific goal was given after this.\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n[Input state:] ... (similar to what we have)\n[Output:]\n\n[ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (2.75,0.9) to table_6\n\nThis suggests that in absence of a specified task, maybe the default goal is simply moving to an object.\n\nBut since I\'m already at table_6 according to the latest state provided:\n\nName: table\nID: table_6\nPosition: (3.5, 0.5)\nContents_count: empty\n\nThus perhaps task was to reach table. But it\'s ambiguous with no clear goal given initially.\n\nGiven ambiguity in the task, without a specified goal as per initial problem description ("None" repeated), it seems there might be missing information.\n\nHowever, if we assume that after reaching the table with pepper_4 in inventory (from unknown previous state), and now seeing other peppers on the floor near table, perhaps the goal is to collect all peppers - a reasonable default task for this type situation.\n\nProceeding under this assumption:\n\nCurrent inventory: pepper_4\nPepper_5 at (3.5,1.0)\nPepper_3 at (3.5,1.5)\n\nAction Plan:\n1. move to position (3.5, 1.0)\n2. take pepper_5 from FLOOR\n3. move to position (3.5, 1.5)\n4. take pepper_3 from FLOOR\n\nThis would collect all peppers with minimal steps (two moves and two takes).\n\nBut let\'s confirm current assumptions:\n- Current pos: table at (3.5,0.5). Does being at a table\'s position imply same coordinates as table? If so then need to move away in x or y first.\n- Alternatively maybe "at" table is like standing near it but not necessarily occupying table\'s coordinate.\n\nOriginal action was: moved from (2.75,0.9) to table_6\n\nThis likely sets my position to the same coordinates as table_6 which is at (3.5, 0.5). So I am now located at (3.5, 0.5).\n\nFrom here:\n\nTo reach pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0):\n- Currently at y=0.5\n- Target y=1.0\n\nAssuming movement in y direction only (x stays same): can move directly to (3.5,1.0)\n\nSimilarly for next pepper.\n\nThus plan seems valid under general grid movement rules.\n\n### Verification:\nAre there any constraints like line of sight needed before taking from floor? Problem doesn\'t specify so assume direct interaction possible after moving adjacent.\n\nAlternative action order: could first move up to 1.5 and then down to 1.0, but would take same number of steps just in different order - not better.\n\nThus proposed plan is minimal (4 actions total).\n\nBut wait - perhaps peppers can be taken from floor without being at exact position? The \'take_from\' action requires being nearby object_id (FLOOR in this case). Typically being on FLOOR implies the current position\'s coordinates are where you\'re standing on floor.\n\nIf position represents center point around which interactions happen within some radius, then maybe taking is possible from nearby positions.\n\nBut problem says: "Only use this [take_from], when you are nearby B" - B is \'FLOOR\' in this case. So do we need to be at exact position of pepper?\n\nProblem statement earlier says contents_count for table is "empty", and peppers have their own positions, implying they\'re on the floor near but not inside table (since table contents are empty).\n\nThus likely to take an item from floor, human must move to its exact (x,y) position.\n\nIn our case:\n- pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0)\nso before taking pepper_5, must be at (3.5,1.0)\n\nSimilarly for pepper_3 must be at (3.5,1.5)\n\nThus initial plan is correct in terms of movement needs.\n\nAdditional checks:\nAre there any other objects to consider? Original perception only lists table and peppers.\nNo mention of doors or other furniture that might block path.\n\nAssuming movement between these positions is unobstructed:\n- From (3.5,0.5) can move directly up to (3.5,1.0)\n- Then from there up to (3.5,1.5)\n\nNo need for additional x movement\n\nThus final action sequence:\n\nStep 1: move to position (3.5,1.0)\nStep 2: take pepper_5 from FLOOR\nStep 3: move to position (3.5,1.5)\nStep 4: take pepper_3 from FLOOR\n\nThis would collect all peppers with minimal steps under default assumption that task is collecting all visible peppers.\n\nBut again original problem had unspecified goal - if alternative goals were intended (e.g., arrange peppers on table), action plan would differ. But given info this seems reasonable.\n\n</think>\n\n### Summary\nGiven the initial state and no specified goal, we assume the task is to collect all peppers in the room. The minimal action sequence involves moving to each pepper\'s position and picking them up one by one.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n1. Move to (3.5, 1.0)\n2. Take pepper_5 from FLOOR\n3. Move to (3.5, 1.5)\n4. Take pepper_3 from FLOOR\n\nThis ensures all peppers are collected with minimal actions and no extraneous steps.\n\n```json\n[\n  {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.0"}},\n  {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "pepper_5"}},\n  {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "pepper_3"}}\n]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2138, 'prompt_tokens': 1653, 'total_tokens': 3791, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-435', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019aff21-745f-7d60-aa34-dee2bbc9fd37-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1653, 'output_tokens': 2138, 'total_tokens': 3791, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
