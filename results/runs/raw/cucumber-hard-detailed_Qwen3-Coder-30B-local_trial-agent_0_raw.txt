Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [48] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I need to evaluate if it's ready for execution.

The plan is: "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table."

This plan is too high-level and needs decomposition into specific actions. Before execution can begin, I need to:
1. Determine where the cucumber might be located
2. Move to that location
3. Identify and pick up the cucumber
4. Move to the table
5. Place the cucumber on the table

The current plan doesn't specify any of these concrete steps or the spatial relationships between objects. It's a single high-level task that requires breaking down into actionable sub-goals.

No, the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution. It needs to be broken down into specific actions like moving to locations, identifying objects, and executing the pick-up and placement actions.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I need to decompose the high-level goal into more specific actions. The plan "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table" needs to be broken down into executable steps.

The decomposition should consider:
1. Finding where the cucumber is located
2. Moving to that location
3. Picking up the cucumber
4. Moving to the table
5. Placing the cucumber on the table

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [48] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I need to evaluate if it's ready for execution.

The plan is: "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table."

This plan is too high-level and needs decomposition into specific actions. Before execution can begin, I need to:
1. Determine where the cucumber might be located
2. Move to that location
3. Identify and pick up the cucumber
4. Move to the table
5. Place the cucumber on the table

The current plan doesn't specify any of these concrete steps or the spatial relationships between objects. It's a single high-level task that requires breaking down into actionable sub-goals.

No, the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution. It needs to be broken down into specific actions like moving to locations, identifying objects, and executing the pick-up and placement actions.

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Plan tree:
- [48] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Looking at the plan tree, the current focus is "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table." This is a composite task that needs to be broken down into specific actions.

The task is not yet complete because:
1. We haven't actually found the cucumber yet
2. We haven't picked it up
3. We haven't placed it on the table

This is still the best leaf task to pursue next because it represents the complete goal that needs to be achieved. However, it should be broken down into more specific subtasks like "Find cucumber" → "Pick up cucumber" → "Move to table" → "Place cucumber on table" for proper execution.

But as a single task, it's still the correct focus - we need to execute the entire sequence to achieve the goal.

Decision: No, this is not the best leaf task to pursue next. It should be broken down into more specific actions.

Wait, re-reading the instructions - I need to choose the minimal action sequence that achieves the requested goal and nothing else. The current focus is the complete goal, so I should proceed with executing it as a single task.

Actually, looking more carefully at the format, this appears to be asking whether the current task is still the best to pursue, and the answer is yes - this is the goal we need to achieve.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Looking at the plan and the current state:

The plan is: "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table."

What has been accomplished:
1. Found the cucumber at position (3.5,1.5) - ✅
2. Picked it up (cucumber_3 is now in inventory) - ✅
3. Moved to the table position (3.5,0.5) - ✅
4. Placed the cucumber on the table - ❌

The agent has successfully found and picked up the cucumber, and has moved to the table position, but has not yet placed the cucumber on the table. The task is not complete because the final step of placing the cucumber on the table has not been executed.

The agent needs to drop the cucumber at the table position (3.5,0.5) to complete the task.

**No, the plan is not completed.** The cucumber has been picked up and the agent is at the table position, but the final action of placing the cucumber on the table has not been performed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Looking at the current state and the plan:

The plan states "Look around the kitchen for a cucumber" but this is no longer necessary since the cucumber has already been located at (3.5,1.5) and picked up. The agent is currently at position (3.5,1.5) with the cucumber in inventory, and the table is at (3.5,0.5).

The recent actions have already accomplished the "find and pick up" portion of the task. The next logical step is to move to the table and place the cucumber there, not to look around for the cucumber again.

The plan is no longer promising because:
1. The cucumber has already been found and picked up
2. The agent is repeating an action (looking around) that has already been completed
3. The agent is not making progress toward the final step of placing the cucumber on the table

The agent should move to the table position (3.5,0.5) and place the cucumber there to complete the task.

The plan is no longer promising because the cucumber has already been found and picked up, and the agent is repeating an action (looking around) that has already been completed, rather than progressing to the final step of placing the cucumber on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I can see that the goal "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table" is not yet decomposed into executable actions. The plan tree shows only the top-level goal without breaking it down into specific steps like "move to cucumber position", "pick up cucumber", "move to table position", and "place cucumber on table".

However, I have already observed the cucumber at (3.5,1.5) and the table at (3.5,0.5), and I've successfully picked up the cucumber. The remaining step is to move to the table and place the cucumber there.

Since I have all the necessary information and the task is essentially complete (just need to move to table and place), I should decompose the plan into the remaining actions.

No, the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution because it only contains the top-level goal without specific executable actions. I need to decompose it into the remaining steps: move to table position and place the cucumber.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I can see that the goal has been partially achieved. The cucumber has been picked up and is in the agent's inventory, but it still needs to be placed on the table.

The plan should be refined to reflect the remaining action needed to complete the task.

**Refined plan:**
- [49] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
  - [49.1] Move to table position (3.5,0.5)
  - [49.2] Place cucumber_3 on the table

However, since the agent is already at the cucumber position and has picked it up, the next logical step is to move to the table and place it. But looking at the current state, the agent is at (3.5,1.5) with the cucumber in inventory, and needs to move to (3.5,0.5) to place it.

The most concise update is to simply execute the remaining action:

**Plan update:**
- [49] Move to table at (3.5,0.5) and place cucumber_3 there

This directly addresses the remaining task without unnecessary decomposition.

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [49] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Looking at the current plan tree, I can see that the goal "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table" is not yet decomposed into executable actions. The plan tree shows only the top-level goal without breaking it down into specific steps like "move to cucumber position", "pick up cucumber", "move to table position", and "place cucumber on table".

However, I have already observed the cucumber at (3.5,1.5) and the table at (3.5,0.5), and I've successfully picked up the cucumber. The remaining step is to move to the table and place the cucumber there.

Since I have all the necessary information and the task is essentially complete (just need to move to table and place), I should decompose the plan into the remaining actions.

No, the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution because it only contains the top-level goal without specific executable actions. I need to decompose it into the remaining steps: move to table position and place the cucumber.

                    Update like this: Looking at the current plan tree, I can see that the goal has been partially achieved. The cucumber has been picked up and is in the agent's inventory, but it still needs to be placed on the table.

The plan should be refined to reflect the remaining action needed to complete the task.

**Refined plan:**
- [49] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
  - [49.1] Move to table position (3.5,0.5)
  - [49.2] Place cucumber_3 on the table

However, since the agent is already at the cucumber position and has picked it up, the next logical step is to move to the table and place it. But looking at the current state, the agent is at (3.5,1.5) with the cucumber in inventory, and needs to move to (3.5,0.5) to place it.

The most concise update is to simply execute the remaining action:

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Plan tree:
- [49] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Looking at the current situation, I need to complete the task of placing the cucumber on the table. The cucumber is already in my inventory (picked up in the previous step), and I know the table position (3.5,0.5). The next logical step is to move to the table and place the cucumber there.

However, I should reconsider the plan structure. The original plan was "Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table" which is a single task. But I've already completed the "find and pick up" part, so now I need to execute the "place it on the table" part.

The current focus is still the best leaf task to pursue next because:
1. The cucumber is already in inventory
2. I know the table location
3. I need to move to the table and place the cucumber there to complete the task

I should move to (3.5,0.5) and place the cucumber on the table.

The task is complete after placing the cucumber on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I observe the table at position (3.5,0.5) which is the target location for placing the cucumber. The table is currently empty and has no contents. The cucumber is already in my inventory (cucumber_3). I need to move to the table position and place the cucumber there to complete the task.

No new discoveries beyond what's already established. The table position and state are confirmed, and the cucumber is confirmed to be in inventory.

Plan:
Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naive Approach:**

1. **Move** to position (3.5,1.5) - to reach the cucumber
2. **Take** cucumber_3 - to pick up the cucumber
3. **Move** to position (3.5,0.5) - to reach the table
4. **Put** cucumber_3 on table - to place the cucumber on the table

This is the simplest sequence of actions needed to complete the task.

Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().
