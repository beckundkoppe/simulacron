[observer] I observe a cucumber at position (3.5, 1.5) and a potato at position (0.5, 1.5). The cucumber is relevant to my goal of picking it up and placing it on the table. The potato is not relevant to the goal. The table is at position (3.5, 0.5) and is empty. The chest is at position (2.0, 2.0) and is closed and unlocked.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to (3.5, 1.5) to pick up the cucumber.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effects of actions:**
- Moved to cucumber position (3.5, 1.5)
- Collected the cucumber

**Facts:**
- Cucumber is now in inventory
- Human is at position (3.5, 1.5)

**Assumptions that proved right:**
- Cucumber exists at (3.5, 1.5) - confirmed
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and empty - confirmed
- Chest is at (2.0, 2.0) - confirmed

**Assumptions that proved wrong:**
- None in this step

**Next step needed:** Move to table position (3.5, 0.5) and place cucumber there.

[observer] I observe:
- Cucumber is in my inventory (confirmed from previous step)
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and empty (confirmed)
- Chest is at (2.0, 2.0), closed, unlocked (confirmed)
- Potato is at (0.5, 1.5) (new discovery, not relevant to goal)

The cucumber is relevant (already collected) and the table is relevant (destination). The chest and potato are not relevant to the goal.
