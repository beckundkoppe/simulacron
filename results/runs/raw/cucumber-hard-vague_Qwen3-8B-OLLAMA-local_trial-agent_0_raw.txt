Goal: Place the cucumber on the table.
Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal "Place the cucumber on the table" requires subtasks like locating the cucumber, picking it up, navigating to the table, and putting it down. Without these decomposed steps, the plan cannot be executed directly. 

**Answer:** No, the plan needs decomposition into subtasks (e.g., "Pick up cucumber," "Go to table," "Put cucumber on table") before execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined Plan:
1. Take the cucumber from its current location. (Assuming it's not already in hand)
2. Place the cucumber on the table. 

This decomposition ensures the agent first acquires the cucumber before attempting to place it, covering the minimal necessary steps.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed. The two steps—taking the cucumber and placing it on the table—directly address the goal with minimal actions. No additional checks (e.g., verifying the cucumber's location) are needed, as the plan assumes the cucumber is not already in hand or on the table. Execution can proceed with these two steps. 

**Answer:** Yes.

Goal: Place the cucumber on the table.
Plan tree:
- [29] Place the cucumber on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes, the current focus remains the best leaf task. The cucumber is already in hand, the table is directly south (current position), and the table is unoccupied. No additional movement is required—simply drop the cucumber on the table to complete the goal.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] The table at (3.5,0.5) is empty and unoccupied. No obstacles block the path. The cucumber is in hand.  
**New discovery:** The table is ready to receive the cucumber.  
**Action:** Move to (3.5,0.5) and drop the cucumber on the table.

Plan:
Place the cucumber on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Move to (3.5,0.5) and drop the cucumber on the table.

[user] Plan:
Place the cucumber on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Drop the cucumber on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
