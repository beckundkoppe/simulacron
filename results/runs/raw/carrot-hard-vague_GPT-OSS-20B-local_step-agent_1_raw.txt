[reflector] **Effect of the actions**

- The carrot is now on the table at (1.0, 4.0).  
- The table is no longer empty.  
- The human is no longer holding the carrot (the carrot is now on the table).  

**Assumptions made**

1. The carrot was reachable and could be picked up.  
2. The table was reachable and could receive the carrot.  

**Outcome**

Both assumptions proved correct: the carrot was successfully moved to the table, and the table now contains the carrot.
