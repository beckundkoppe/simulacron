[reflector] **Facts after the attempted action:**

- The room contains no potato.  
- The table is present and accessible.  

**Assumptions made during the action sequence:**

| Assumption | Status |
|------------|--------|
| A potato exists in the room | **Wrong** – it was absent. |
| The potato could be picked up | **Wrong** – impossible because it didn’t exist. |
| The table is a valid placement surface | **Correct** – the table is present. |
| The agent can move to the table and place an object there | **Correct** – the movement and placement mechanics work. |

**Summary:**  
The action failed because the prerequisite object (the potato) was missing. All other assumptions about the environment and the agent’s capabilities were valid.

[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- The agent moved from its starting position (0, 0) to the location of `door_6` (4, 4).  
- No other objects were touched or moved.

1. `door_6` exists at coordinates (4, 4).  
2. The agent can move to that location.  
3. The door is closed but unlocked, so it can be opened later if desired.  
4. The key and table remain unchanged.  
5. No potato is present.

**Assumptions that proved right / wrong**

- **Right**:  
  - Door exists at (4, 4).  
  - Agent can move there.  
  - Door is closed but unlocked.  
  - Key and table remain unchanged.  
  - No potato is present.

- The agent moved from the table (0, 3) to the key’s location (3, 1) and picked up the key.

- The door at (4, 4) stays open.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries. The perception confirms the table at (0, 3) is empty, the door at (4, 4) is open, and the key is already in your inventory.

[action_imaginator] Move to the open door at (4, 4).

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- The agent moved from the table at (0, 3) to the open door at (4, 4).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or otherwise altered.

**Current facts**  
| Object | State |
|--------|-------|
| Agent  | at door (4, 4), holding key |
| Key    | in agent’s inventory |
| Table  | empty, at (0, 3) |
| Door   | open, at (4, 4) |
| Potato | absent |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. The table still exists at (0, 3).  
2. The agent can move to the door’s location.  
3. The door remains open.  
4. The key remains in the agent’s inventory.  
5. No potato is present.

**Assumptions proved right**  
All five assumptions hold true.
