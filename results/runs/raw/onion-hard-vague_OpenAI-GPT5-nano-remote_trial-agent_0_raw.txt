Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [0] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan currently has only a single high-level action. To execute it deterministically, we need explicit substeps for locating the onion and compost, moving between locations, and performing the pick up and drop actions (including any door interactions if needed). Without those, the agent won’t know how to proceed.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Suggested decomposed plan (minimal steps, assuming no blocked doors and known locations):
- [0.1] Move to the onion’s location.
- [0.2] Pick up the onion.
- [0.3] Move to the compost outside.
- [0.4] Drop the onion into the compost.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief): The tree covers the essential contingencies: whether you’re holding the onion, whether you’re outside, and how to reach the compost (including opening a door). It’s structured as conditional branches leading to a minimal sequence: go to onion, pick it up, get outside, move to compost, drop. A minor redundancy exists (0.1.1 under 0.1) and it doesn’t handle the case where a door is locked (no unlock step), but these don’t prevent starting execution under common assumptions.

Decision: Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution (with a note to add unlock handling if doors can be locked).

1) Move to onion on table_2 at (3, 3.25)
2) Take onion
3) Move to the compost outside location
4) Drop onion

If a door blocks the way to the outside, you may need to open/unlock it before step 3.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.75,0.75) to onion_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of actions:
- You moved from (0.75, 0.75) to the onion’s location (3, 3.25), so you are now at onion_3’s position.
- The onion remains on table_2 at (3, 3.25) and is still present.
- Your inventory is still empty (you did not pick up the onion).

Facts after the action:
- Agent position: (3, 3.25) (at onion_3)
- Onion_3 location and contents: on table_2 at (3,3.25); contains onion
- Inventory: []

Assumptions about the new state:
- No pickup occurred during the move.
- No other state changes (doors, table contents) occurred.

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: You are at onion_3’s location; the onion is still on the table; your inventory is empty.
- Right (given the plan): No automatic pickup happened during the move.
- Potentially wrong only if the environment auto-picked the onion on contact; but there was no such action in the plan, so this assumption remains untested and likely correct.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: The plan only says to move to the onion if not holding it. You are already at the onion and not holding it, so the precondition is met, but this step does not accomplish bringing the onion to the compost. To complete the goal, you would need to pick up the onion and carry/drop it into the compost outside.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [9] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief): The current plan tree contains a single high-level action. To execute it, you must decompose into concrete steps: pick up the onion, travel to the outside compost (likely via the door), and drop the onion there. Without specifying these sub-actions, execution isn’t possible.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Decomposed minimal plan (recommended):
- Take onion from table_2
- Move to exterior door (inside)
- Go through door to outside
- Move to compost location outside
- Drop onion into compost

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected onion_3 from table_2
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of actions:
- Onion was picked up from table_2 and added to your inventory.

Current facts:
- Agent position: (3, 3.25)
- Inventory: [onion]
- Onion_3 location: in inventory
- Table_2 at (3, 3.25): contents = empty

Assumptions about the new state:
- No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true (the pickup was explicit).
- Onion would remain on the table unless picked: false (it was picked up).
- You would still be at onion location after the action: true (no movement occurred).

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: You are at onion’s location; onion is now in your inventory; onion_3 is not on the table.
- Wrong: Onion remaining on table_2 after the action; it has been removed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed. Reason: The onion has already been taken into the inventory, but the plan's second step—slicing the onion into thin rings—is not supported by the available actions. There is no “slice” action (or knife/tool) defined in the environment, so the plan cannot be fully executed as stated. If slicing becomes an allowable action (or a knife becomes available), we could complete it.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3,3.25) to (0,0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of actions:
  - You moved from (3,3.25) to (0,0).
  - Onion stays in your inventory; onion_3 is in inventory; table_2 remains empty.
  - No slicing action occurred (no evidence of "slice into rings").

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: (0,0)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2 at (3,3.25): contents = empty

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: wrong (you moved to (0,0)).
  - Onion would be sliced into rings: not performed (no action executed to slice).
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true (the onion was already in inventory; no new pickup happened).

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: You are at (0,0); onion is in your inventory; onion_3 not on the table.
  - Wrong: Onion remaining on table_2 after the action; it has been removed to inventory.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: The plan has two parts—pick up the onion from table_2 and slice it into thin rings. The onion is already in your inventory, so the first part is done. However, no slicing has been performed, and slicing isn’t an available action in the described environment, so the second part cannot be completed as stated.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: The plan’s next step is to slice the onion that’s now in your inventory. Recent actions did not perform slicing and actually moved you away from the onion, with no progress toward the slicing step. Therefore the plan is not currently promising.

Answer: No

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reason: The plan’s next step is to slice the onion that’s now in your inventory. Recent actions did not perform slicing and actually moved you away from the onion, with no progress toward the slicing step. Therefore the plan is not currently promising.

Answer: No

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [13] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
The current plan is a single high-level goal with no concrete steps to reach the outside compost and no explicit drop action. To execute reliably, we need explicit subgoals: how to get outside (which door to use) and where to drop the onion in the compost.

Decision:
Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended decomposed plan:
- [13.1] Go through a door to the outside (e.g., through Door_15 at (4, 1.75)).
- [13.2] Move to the compost location outside.
- [13.3] Drop the onion into the compost.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not yet. The current plan assumes you are at Door_15 to open it, but you are at (0,0). You need explicit steps to reach a door before you can open or go through it, so the plan isn’t sufficiently decomposed for execution from your current state.

Proposed decomposed plan from now:
- Primary path via Door_15
  1) Move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75)
  2) Open Door_15 (currently closed, unlocked)
  3) Go Through Door_15
  4) Move to compost_outside location
  5) Drop onion into compost_outside

- Fallback path via Door_14 (if Door_15 cannot be used)
  6) Open Door_14 (closed, unlocked)
  7) Go Through Door_14
  8) Move to compost_outside
  9) Drop onion into compost_outside

Given onion is in your inventory, you can execute the drop once you’re at the compost_outside.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan suggestions:

- Keep primary path (practical and minimal):
  - [13] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
    - [13.1] Open Door_15
    - [13.2] Go Through Door_15

  - [13.2a] Go Through Door_14
  - [13.3a] Move to compost_outside
  - [13.4a] Drop onion into compost_outside

Rationale:
- The primary route through Door_15 is sufficient since Door_15 is closed but unlocked, and the onion is already in the inventory. This yields a minimal four-step sequence.
- The Door_14 fallback is optional in case the primary door path is blocked; it can be kept as an archived alternative rather than active in the current plan to avoid extra steps.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- It breaks the goal into concrete, prerequisite actions: open the door, go through the door, move to the compost outside, then drop the onion.
- Current state satisfies the preconditions: onion is in the inventory, you’re at the starting location, and Door_14 is closed but unlocked (so you need to open it before passing).
- The steps cover the full sequence without missing prerequisites or requiring implicit actions.

Recommendation: start with [13.1a] Open Door_14, then proceed with [13.2a] Go Through Door_14, [13.3a] Move to compost_outside, and [13.4a] Drop onion into compost_outside.

Plan:
[13.1a] Open Door_14 (closed, unlocked) - Fallback
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] The naive, minimal sequence is:
- Move to (0.2, 5)
- Open Door_14

Reason: Door_14 is closed but unlocked, so you must reach it and then open it.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] door_14 is too far away to interact. Hint: Move closer to the object before interacting.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of actions: The attempt to open door_14 failed because it was too far away. No state changes occurred except the action was wasted. You remain at (0,0) with the onion in inventory.

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: (0,0)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2 at (3,3.25): contents = empty
  - Door_14 at (0.2, 5): closed, unlocked
  - Door_15 at (4, 1.75): closed, unlocked
  - Other noted items unchanged (banana peel, paper scrap, cucumber, carrot, radish)

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: True
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: False (no movement of onion and no slicing)
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: True (no move occurred)

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Position unchanged at (0,0); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 in inventory; table_2 still empty; doors_14/15 remain closed but unlocked.
  - Wrong: The assumption that interacting with door_14 would succeed/open the door; instead the action failed due to distance.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: Door_14 is still closed and far away at (0.2, 5); your last attempt to open it failed due to distance, and you are currently at (0,0). The plan requires successfully opening Door_14, which has not occurred.

Minimal next steps to complete: Move closer to door_14, then open it. For example: Move to a position near the door (e.g., around (0.2, 4.9)), then perform Open Door_14. If opening isn’t possible from that position, you could push from the handle side as a fallback.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason: Door_14 is still closed and far away at (0.2, 5); your last attempt to open it failed due to distance, and you are currently at (0,0). The plan requires successfully opening Door_14, which has not occurred.

Minimal next steps to complete: Move closer to door_14, then open it. For example: Move to a position near the door (e.g., around (0.2, 4.9)), then perform Open Door_14. If opening isn’t possible from that position, you could push from the handle side as a fallback.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Short reasoning:
The plan is not promising right now. The door is far away (0.2,5) and the last attempt to open it failed due to distance, producing no state change. We are still at (0,0) with the onion, and no progress toward opening Door_14 has occurred. We should first move closer to the door before attempting to open.

Conclusion: No, the plan is not promising in this state.

Suggested minimal next actions:
- Move toward Door_14 to be within reach (e.g., move to (0.2, 5)).
- Then Open Door_14 (closed, unlocked).

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [22] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
The current plan is only a high-level goal. To execute, we need concrete subgoals: how to get outside (which door and how), where the compost outside is located, and the exact action to deposit the onion. Without these, the plan isn’t actionable.

Decision:
Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution as-is.

Proposed decomposition (minimal, actionable steps):
- 22.1 Decide exit route: use door_15 (closest unlocked door) or door_14 if needed.
- 22.2 Move to door_15 at (4, 1.75).
- 22.3 Open/through door_15 to outside (door_15 is closed but unlocked; opening is possible if close enough).
- 22.4 Move to compost_outside location (coordinate to be specified).
- 22.5 Drop onion into compost_outside.
- 22.6 End state: onion no longer in inventory; onion deposited in compost outside.

If you want, I can proceed with a concrete, minimal action sequence by assuming a specific outside compost location (please provide coordinates or permit me to choose a plausible one).

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Plan refinement for goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.

Proposed decomposition of node 22 (current focus) into minimal, actionable steps:

- 22.1 Move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75)
- 22.2 Go through Door_15 to the outside (door is closed but unlocked; this assumes go-through is allowed when adjacent)
- 22.3 Move to the compost outside location (compost_outside)
- 22.4 Drop onion at compost_outside

Fallback path if Door_15 is unusable (distance or blocked):
- 22.5 Move to Door_14 at (0.2, 5)
- 22.6 Go through Door_14 to the outside
- 22.7 Move to compost_outside
- 22.8 Drop onion at compost_outside

Notes:
- Onion is already in inventory, so no prep substep needed.
- No slicing or extra actions are required.
- This plan keeps changes minimal and uses the nearest exit first (Door_15) to minimize travel. If Door_15 cannot be used, switch to the Door_14 branch.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [22] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
  - [23] 22.1 Move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75)
  - [24] 22.2 Go through Door_15 to the outside (door is closed but unlocked; this assumes go-through is allowed when adjacent)
  - [25] 22.3 Move to the compost outside location (compost_outside)
  - [26] 22.4 Drop onion at compost_outside
  - [27] 22.5 Move to Door_14 at (0.2, 5)
  - [28] 22.6 Go through Door_14 to the outside
  - [29] 22.7 Move to compost_outside
  - [30] 22.8 Drop onion at compost_outside

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: No. The current plan contains redundant back-and-forth steps (going outside, then back through another door, then back to the compost) that are unnecessary to achieve the goal. The onion only needs to be moved to the compost outside once, so the plan can be decomposed into a simple four-step sequence.

Recommended minimal plan:
- Move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75)
- Go through Door_15 to the outside (door is closed but unlocked)
- Move to the compost_outside
- Drop onion at compost_outside

This achieves the goal with the fewest actions given the current state.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan: prune redundant steps and shorten to the minimal path.

  - [24] Go through Door_15 to the outside
  - [25] Move to compost_outside
  - [26] Drop onion at compost_outside

Rationale: The previous plan included unnecessary moves through Door_14 and two drops. Since the onion is already in inventory, we only need a single path to the outside and a single drop at the compost. If the go-through action fails due to distance, fallback to Door_14 is possible, but the simplified plan assumes adjacency as allowed.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
The plan tree is decomposed into concrete steps and can be executed, but it is not minimal: it includes unnecessary back-and-forth (going outside and back inside) and two deposits, plus an assumption about passing through Door 15 when adjacent. A shorter sequence can achieve the same goal more safely.

Decision:
Not the most efficient decomposition. A simpler plan suffices.

Minimal plan to achieve the goal:
- Move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75)
- Go through Door_15 to the outside
- Move to the compost_outside
- Drop onion at compost_outside

Assumptions about the new state:
- You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you’re at Door_15 now)
- Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false (no such action occurred)
- No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: You are at (4.0, 1.75); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 in inventory; table_2 remains empty; doors_14/15 remain closed but unlocked.
- Wrong: Being at the onion location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup (none occurred).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is completed.

Reason: The goal was to move to Door_15 at (4, 1.75). You are now exactly at (4.0, 1.75), so the destination was reached. No extra actions were required by the plan, and the onion remains in inventory as before. If you want, you can issue a new plan to go through the door (e.g., Open or Go through Door_15).

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action: You attempted to go through Door_15 to the outside from (4.0, 1.75). If successful, you would be outside (new position outside the door); onion remains in your inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; other items unchanged. If unsuccessful, you remain at (4.0, 1.75) with the same state.

- Facts (assuming success): Agent outside the room (position not specified), Inventory [onion], onion_3 in inventory, Table_2 empty, Door_15 used/opened to pass, Door_14 unchanged, all other items as previously observed.

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you would be outside).
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false (no such action occurred).
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true.

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14/Door_15 states unchanged if the action failed (and overall no automatic pickups occurred).
  - Wrong: Being at the onion location after the action; the onion being moved/opened by this action (no such movement occurred).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Result summary:
- You push Door_15 and it opens. You did not move through yet. You remain at (4.0, 1.75). Onion and onion_3 stay in inventory. Table_2 remains empty.

Current facts:
- Agent position: (4.0, 1.75)
- Inventory: [onion]
- Onion_3 location: in inventory
- Table_2: empty
- Door_15: open
- Door_14: closed, unlocked
- Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
- Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
- Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
- Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
- Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
- Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty

Assumptions about the new state:
- You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are at (4.0, 1.75))
- Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false (no movement of onion)
- No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 now open.
- Wrong: Being at the onion location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (the door opened, not the onion).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan’s goal is to go through Door_15 to the outside. You’re currently at Door_15 and it is open, but you have not moved through yet. Exiting requires one more action (go through).

Plan completed? No.

Next action: Go through Door_15 to the outside.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: Door_15 has been opened and you are standing at its location, immediately ready to go through to the outside. The next step in the plan (step through) can be executed now, with onion still in inventory and no other state changes blocking progress.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_15 into hallway
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action: You pushed Door_15, it opened, and you went through to the hallway outside. You remain with the onion in inventory; onion_3 stays in inventory. Table_2 remains empty.

Current facts:
- Agent position: outside the room, in the hallway (exact coordinates not specified)
- Inventory: [onion]
- Onion_3 location: in inventory
- Table_2: empty
- Door_15: open (you have passed through)
- Door_14: closed, unlocked
- Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
- Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
- Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
- Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
- Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
- Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty

Assumptions about the new state:
- You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are outside the door)
- Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false (no such action occurred)
- No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 now open.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan’s goal is to go through Door_15 to the outside. The latest state shows Door_15 open and you are in the hallway outside (position (0, 1.75)), with the onion still in inventory and table_2 still empty. Therefore the objective is achieved.

Decision: Plan completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan’s goal is to go through Door_15 to the outside. The latest state shows Door_15 open and you are in the hallway outside (position (0, 1.75)), with the onion still in inventory and table_2 still empty. Therefore the objective is achieved.

Decision: Plan completed.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Result reflection (short)

- Effect of the action:
  - You moved along the main garden path from (0,1.75) to (0.5, 0). No other state changes.

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: (0.5, 0)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 at (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 at (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
  - Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
  - Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty
  - Compost_outside: not yet observed

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you moved to (0.5, 0))
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Position updated to (0.5, 0); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; table_2 remains empty; Door_14 remains closed/unlocked; Door_15 remains open
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup (none occurred)

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed yet.

Reason: The goal is to reach compost_outside. You’re currently at (0.5, 0) near the garden gate (door_23), which is closed but unlocked. You have not actually passed through it to the outside, so you haven’t reached compost_outside.

Next minimal action: go through door_23 to outside (then you’re effectively at compost_outside). Onion remains in inventory.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed yet.

Reason: The goal is to reach compost_outside. You’re currently at (0.5, 0) near the garden gate (door_23), which is closed but unlocked. You have not actually passed through it to the outside, so you haven’t reached compost_outside.

Next minimal action: go through door_23 to outside (then you’re effectively at compost_outside). Onion remains in inventory.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. The open door_15 on the main garden path (0,1.75) provides a direct route to compost_outside, and you’re already on that path with no blockers, so moving through the gate will progress toward the target in a few steps.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. The open door_15 on the main garden path (0,1.75) provides a direct route to compost_outside, and you’re already on that path with no blockers, so moving through the gate will progress toward the target in a few steps.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_23 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Result reflection (short)

- Effect of the action:
  - You went through door_23 from the hallway into the chamber. You are now in the chamber; door_23 is open. Onion and onion_3 remain in inventory. Table_2 remains empty.

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: in chamber (coordinates not specified)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_23: open (passed through)
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
  - Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
  - Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty
  - Compost_outside: not yet observed

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you moved through the door)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Position updated to inside the chamber; onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 now open/passed through.
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup occurred.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] New discoveries:
- You are in a chamber at position (0.5, 1.5); chamber size extends 1.0 in x and 1.5 in y.
- Door_23 is at (0.5, 1.5) and is open and unlocked (you are at its location).
- No new items observed inside the chamber; compost_outside has not been observed.
- Onion_3 remains in your inventory.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Reason: The goal is to move to compost_outside, but you’re still in the chamber at (0.5, 1.5) with no observation of compost_outside. You need to traverse the garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark, which has not yet been completed.

Suggested next minimal steps:
- Go through door_23 into the hallway.
- Follow the main garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as landmark, until you reach compost_outside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. Reason: The goal is to move to compost_outside, but you’re still in the chamber at (0.5, 1.5) with no observation of compost_outside. You need to traverse the garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark, which has not yet been completed.

Suggested next minimal steps:
- Go through door_23 into the hallway.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.

Reasoning: You’re currently in a chamber with door_23 open at the garden-path location, and the target compost_outside lies along the main garden path. There are no observed obstacles preventing moving toward compost_outside, so continuing toward it remains a straightforward next step rather than a reset or repetition.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.

Reasoning: You’re currently in a chamber with door_23 open at the garden-path location, and the target compost_outside lies along the main garden path. There are no observed obstacles preventing moving toward compost_outside, so continuing toward it remains a straightforward next step rather than a reset or repetition.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_23 into hallway
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Short reflection

- Effect of the action
  - You passed through door_23 from the chamber into the hallway. You are now in the hallway; door_23 remains open. Onion and onion_3 stay in inventory. Table_2 remains empty.

- Current facts (consistent view)
  - Agent position: hallway (coordinates not specified)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Other observed items unchanged (banana peel, paper scrap, cucumber, carrot, radish, chairs)

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you moved to the hallway)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 is open after passing through.
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (no onion movement); any automatic pickup (none occurred).

- Note
  - There is an inconsistency: a later observation places you in the chamber at (0.5, 1.5). Please confirm which location is correct for the current state.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.

Reason: The plan aims to move to compost_outside. You are currently in the hallway at (0.5, 0.0) with no observation of compost_outside, so you haven’t reached the target location yet. You would need to exit outside (via the open doors/gate) and then travel to compost_outside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No.

Reason: The plan aims to move to compost_outside. You are currently in the hallway at (0.5, 0.0) with no observation of compost_outside, so you haven’t reached the target location yet. You would need to exit outside (via the open doors/gate) and then travel to compost_outside.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You’re in the hallway at (0.5, 0.0) with door_23 open, and compost_outside has not been observed yet. Moving along the main garden path toward compost_outside (using the garden gate as a landmark) would produce a concrete state change and potentially reveal the target location.

Plan status: Yes, the plan is promising. Suggested next action: move along the garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: You’re in the hallway at (0.5, 0.0) with door_23 open, and compost_outside has not been observed yet. Moving along the main garden path toward compost_outside (using the garden gate as a landmark) would produce a concrete state change and potentially reveal the target location.

Plan status: Yes, the plan is promising. Suggested next action: move along the garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_23 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Short reflection

- Effect of the action:
  - You passed through door_23 from the hallway into the chamber. You are now in the chamber; door_23 is open. Onion and onion_3 remain in inventory. Table_2 remains empty. Door_15 open; Door_14 closed/unlocked.

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: in chamber at (0.5, 1.5)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0); Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber (0.7, 3.8); Carrot (2.8, 3.0); Radish (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you’re in the chamber)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Position updated to inside the chamber; onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open.
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup (none occurred).

- Note: The latest observation places you in the chamber at (0.5, 1.5). If you want to align to a single current location, the chamber (0.5, 1.5) is the most recent consistent state.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason:
- The plan targets moving to compost_outside, but you are currently in the chamber at (0.5,1.5) with compost_outside not observed yet. No action has been taken along the main garden path toward compost_outside. You’d need to exit through open doors (e.g., door_23) and proceed along the garden path toward the gate to reach compost_outside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason:
- The plan targets moving to compost_outside, but you are currently in the chamber at (0.5,1.5) with compost_outside not observed yet. No action has been taken along the main garden path toward compost_outside. You’d need to exit through open doors (e.g., door_23) and proceed along the garden path toward the gate to reach compost_outside.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.

Reasoning:
- You have moved onto the chamber side of door_23, which is open, placing you on the direct path toward compost_outside.
- You have a usable landmark (the garden gate) to navigate toward compost_outside, enabling progress toward the plan.
- No repetition or stalled state yet; compost_outside simply hasn’t been observed yet, but the route is still accessible.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.

Reasoning:
- You have moved onto the chamber side of door_23, which is open, placing you on the direct path toward compost_outside.
- You have a usable landmark (the garden gate) to navigate toward compost_outside, enabling progress toward the plan.
- No repetition or stalled state yet; compost_outside simply hasn’t been observed yet, but the route is still accessible.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Result reflection (short)

- Effect of the action:
  - You attempted to move along the main path toward compost_outside, but the action ended with you staying at door_23 (location (0.5,1.5)); no progress toward compost_outside.

- Current facts:
  - Agent position: (0.5, 1.5) at door_23
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber (0.7, 3.8); Carrot (2.8, 3.0); Radish (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5) empty; chair_45 (0.0, 4.5) empty
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you remained at door_23)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; moving toward compost_outside (no movement occurred); any automatic pickup (none occurred)

- Note: To progress toward compost_outside, you’d need to move through door_23 into the adjacent area and follow the garden path from there.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: The target compost_outside has not been reached or observed yet. Current state is still in the chamber at door_23 (0.5, 1.5) with the door open. To complete the plan, you need to move through door_23 into the hallway and then follow the main garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark, until you arrive at/comprehend the compost_outside location.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason: The target compost_outside has not been reached or observed yet. Current state is still in the chamber at door_23 (0.5, 1.5) with the door open. To complete the plan, you need to move through door_23 into the hallway and then follow the main garden path toward compost_outside, using the garden gate as a landmark, until you arrive at/comprehend the compost_outside location.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: The latest attempt to move toward compost_outside produced no state change and did not progress toward the next plan step (you’re still at door_23 in the chamber). To make progress, you’d need to move through door_23 into the hallway and then follow the garden path, which hasn’t occurred yet.

Answer: No. 
(Recommended next action: move through door_23 into the hallway and start along the garden path toward compost_outside.)

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reason: The latest attempt to move toward compost_outside produced no state change and did not progress toward the next plan step (you’re still at door_23 in the chamber). To make progress, you’d need to move through door_23 into the hallway and then follow the garden path, which hasn’t occurred yet.

Answer: No. 
(Recommended next action: move through door_23 into the hallway and start along the garden path toward compost_outside.)

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [35] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is decomposed enough to start execution. It sets a clear end goal (bring the onion outside to compost) and outlines a feasible high-level path: chamber -> through door_23 to hallway -> along the garden path -> reach compost outside and deposit the onion. The main missing detail is the exact location of compost_outside, which can be handled by continuing along the path until it’s observed.

Recommended sub-steps to add for robustness:
- [35.1] Move through door_23 from the chamber into the hallway.
- [35.2] Follow the main garden path toward compost_outside, continuing until you observe it.
- [35.3] Deposit the onion into compost_outside when located.

If you’re ready, start with 35.1.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Plan tree:
- [35] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes. The current leaf task to Bring the onion into the compost outside is still the best focal goal.

Reason (brief):
- Onion is already in your inventory and you’re at the open door to the outside. The goal requires you to exit and deposit the onion in the compost outside, so pursuing that leaf directly is the most direct path with no competing priorities observed.

Suggested next steps:
- Move through door_23 from the chamber to the outside hallway.
- Follow the garden path toward the compost_outside.
- Deposit the onion into the compost_outside when you reach it. If you encounter any obstacles or need to locate the compost, I can help map the route.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_23 into hallway
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Short reflection

- Effect of the action
  - You went through door_23 from the chamber into the hallway. You are now in the hallway; door_23 remains open. Onion and onion_3 stay in inventory. Table_2 remains empty. Door_15 open; Door_14 closed/unlocked.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: hallway
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
  - Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
  - Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are in the hallway)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open after passing through
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup occurred

- Note: To progress toward compost_outside, you’d need to move further along from the hallway into the outdoor path.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason:
- The plan requires moving the onion to the outdoor compost and adding it to the pile. So far, you have not reached outside or deposited the onion—compost_outside has not been observed, and the onion remains in inventory.
- While a route to outside exists via door_18 (far end of the hallway), you have not yet passed through it or located the compost pile.

Suggested next steps to complete:
1) Move along the hallway to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) and pass through to the outside.
2) Locate the outdoor compost pile (if needed, follow the exterior path).
3) Deposit or add the onion (onion_3) into the compost pile.

If you want, I can outline exact actions to proceed step by step.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason:
- The plan requires moving the onion to the outdoor compost and adding it to the pile. So far, you have not reached outside or deposited the onion—compost_outside has not been observed, and the onion remains in inventory.
- While a route to outside exists via door_18 (far end of the hallway), you have not yet passed through it or located the compost pile.

Suggested next steps to complete:
1) Move along the hallway to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) and pass through to the outside.
2) Locate the outdoor compost pile (if needed, follow the exterior path).
3) Deposit or add the onion (onion_3) into the compost pile.

If you want, I can outline exact actions to proceed step by step.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: To execute "bring the onion into the compost outside," you need to move toward and pass through door_18 to reach the outside compost, then deposit the onion. The latest observations show you are still in the hallway at (0.5,0) with door_18 closed/unlocked at the far end and no action taken to approach or deposit the onion. No state change toward the plan has occurred.

No

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: To execute "bring the onion into the compost outside," you need to move toward and pass through door_18 to reach the outside compost, then deposit the onion. The latest observations show you are still in the hallway at (0.5,0) with door_18 closed/unlocked at the far end and no action taken to approach or deposit the onion. No state change toward the plan has occurred.

No

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [36] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The goal is high level and depends on navigating a hallway with several doors and then reaching outside to place the onion in compost. Right now there are multiple potential blockers (closed doors along the path to door_18, and no confirmed outside-compost location). The single high-level plan [36] lacks the necessary sequence of moves and door interactions to reliably succeed, so it isn’t decomposed enough to run.

Decision:
- Not sufficiently decomposed. Start by breaking it into concrete substeps that handle movement, door interactions, and locating the compost outside.

Suggested decomposed plan:
- 36.1: Move from current hallway position (0.5,0) toward door_18 (0.5,5.5), planning to pass through door_23 (already open) and door_15 (open) as needed.
- 36.2: If blocked, open any closed/unlocked doors along the path (e.g., door_21 at (1,2.5), door_17 at (0,4.5), door_19 at (1,4.5), etc.) to clear a route to door_18.
- 36.3: Pass through door_18 to the outside.
- 36.4: Navigate the outside area to locate a compost spot (compost_outside) and verify its location.
- 36.5: Deposit the onion into the compost, ensuring onion_3 remains in inventory.

If you want, I can turn this into a concrete action sequence with conditional checks based on what doors are actually passable in this run.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan for [36] Bring the onion into the compost outside

- 36.1 Move from current hallway (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5). If door_18 is closed, open it (it's closed but unlocked) and pass through to outside.
- 36.2 Locate the compost_outside area from the exterior side (scan along the garden path until compost_outside is found).
- 36.3 Deposit the onion from inventory into compost_outside (confirm placement).
- 36.4 Confirm final state: onion in compost_outside; onion_3 still in inventory; table_2 empty; door_ statuses as observed (door_18 now used to reach outside; door_23/15/14 unchanged unless interacted later).

Pruning / alternative paths (concise):
- If door_18 cannot be accessed or outside location remains unknown, prune 36.2/36.3 and instead:
  - 36.a Explore alternate outside routes from the hallway (e.g., proceed via door_23 back into connected areas to reach another exterior door) and then deposit onion once outside.
- If you already know compost_outside is simply outside door_18, you can skip 36.2 and go directly to 36.3 after passing through 36.1.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- The plan is concrete and actionable: reach exterior via door_18, then locate compost_outside along the garden path, deposit the onion, and confirm the final state.
- It includes success criteria (onion deposited, inventory maintained) and a built-in fallback (alternative exterior route via door_23, per step 41).
- Dependencies are clear and minimal: door_18 must be opened/passable, compost_outside may require exploration, onion stays in inventory throughout.
- Gaps are small: exact location of compost_outside isn’t known yet, but a scan along the exterior path addresses this; no missing preconditions for the core steps.

Decision: Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Optional refinements (brief):
- Add explicit contingencies: if door_18 cannot be opened or exterior path blocked, switch to plan 41 (alternate exterior route via door_23) to reach another exterior door.
- Define a concrete deposit action: once at compost_outside, specify moving onion from inventory to compost_outside and then verify its placement.

[leaf_selector] 36.1

Reason: This directly moves you toward the outside via door_18, which is the only exterior route from your current hallway position. Door_18 is closed but unlocked, so it can be opened and passed through to reach the compost_outside area for subsequent steps (36.2 and 36.3).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] New observations (short):
- Hallway extended: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 5.5; you are at (0.5, 0).
- Door_18 is at (0.5, 5.5), currently closed but unlocked (potential route to outside if opened).
- Kitchen waste bin_32 at (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds.
- Onion_3 remains in inventory (already known, not a new discovery).

Relevance for your focused plan node:
- Primary opportunity: move along the hallway toward door_18 and, if needed, open it to reach outside.
- Key risk: door_18 must be opened (it’s closed but unlocked).  
- Other items (Door_23 open, Door_15 open, compost_outside not observed) are background context.

Plan:
36.1 Move from current hallway (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5). If door_18 is closed, open it (it's closed but unlocked) and pass through to outside.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive, human-executable plan (simple actions):

- Action 36.1: Move from hallway (0.5, 0) to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5).
- Action 36.2: Push/open door_18 (it is closed but unlocked).
- Action 36.3: Pass through door_18 to the outside.

Notes:
- Onion and onion_3 stay in inventory.
- Door_23, Door_15, and other items remain as observed.
- Compost_outside has not been observed.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Result reflection (short)

- Effect of the action
  - You moved along the hallway from (0.5,0) through door_18 at (0.5,5.5) to outside. You opened door_18 (it was closed but unlocked) and passed through. Onion and onion_3 remain in inventory. Table_2 remains empty.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: outside (exact coordinates not specified)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Banana peel_30 in basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31 in basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber at (0.7, 3.8)
  - Carrot at (2.8, 3.0)
  - Radish at (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are outside)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is now open/passable
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (the door opened, not the onion); any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - If you want, we can continue planning from outside toward compost_outside or re-enter via other doors.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- The plan requires moving from (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5) and passing outside. Current state has you still at (0.5,0) in the hallway with door_18 closed but unlocked; no action has moved you to door_18 or outside. Therefore the plan hasn’t been completed yet.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed.

Next step (if you want to proceed):
- Move from (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5); open it if needed (it’s unlocked) and pass through to outside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief):
- The plan requires moving from (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5) and passing outside. Current state has you still at (0.5,0) in the hallway with door_18 closed but unlocked; no action has moved you to door_18 or outside. Therefore the plan hasn’t been completed yet.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed.

Next step (if you want to proceed):
- Move from (0.5,0) to door_18 at (0.5,5.5); open it if needed (it’s unlocked) and pass through to outside.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan 36.1 aims to move from the hallway to door_18 and pass outside. The latest result shows you did exactly that—you passed through door_18 to outside with the onion still in inventory. Therefore the objective is already achieved, and continuing this same plan would be redundant.

Answer: No

Summary: The plan is no longer promising because its goal has been completed (you’re outside). If you want a new objective (e.g., move toward compost_outside from outside, or re-enter), we can formulate a new plan.

A new objective should be defined (e.g., move toward compost_outside from outside, re-enter, or pick up additional items).'}, 'id': 'call_1D9G03p02ZjNXpphJicO3Sn4', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11336, 'output_tokens': 878, 'total_tokens': 12214, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 768}}

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [42] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The plan tree has a single high-level action with no subgoals to locate or reach the compost outside. Compost_outside has not been observed, so there is no defined destination or path. To execute, we need steps to locate the compost site and a path to it, plus the deposit action.

Suggested decomposed plan:
- 42. Bring the onion into the compost outside
  - 42.1 Locate compost_outside
  - 42.2 Move to compost_outside (navigating from current outside position, through open doors as needed)
  - 42.3 Deposit onion into compost_outside
  - 42.4 (optional) Confirm onion deposited and report status

If you want, I can draft a concrete sequence based on the current map (doors and known locations) to reach compost_outside.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan tree (concise)

- [42] Bring the onion into the compost outside
  - [42.1] Move along the hallway from (0.5, 0) to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5)
    - Preconditions: Hallway path clear; door_18 is closed but unlocked
    - Expected effect: You reach door_18
  - [42.2] Open (if needed) and pass through door_18 to outside
    - Preconditions: door_18 closed but unlocked
    - Effect: You are outside; onion remains in inventory
  - [42.3] Locate compost_outside (if not yet observed) and move toward it
    - Preconditions: Outside location accessible; path toward compost known
    - Effect: Approach compost_outside
  - [42.4] Deposit onion into compost_outside
    - Preconditions: Onion in inventory
    - Effect: Onion placed in compost outside; goal achieved

Pruning / refinement notes

- If compost_outside cannot be found after outdoors, prune [42.3] and add a search subtask for likely compost areas outside.
- If you want to accelerate, combine [42.2] and [42.3] into a single step “Go outside toward compost area,” but keep separate to handle unknown outdoor layout.
- Keep a fallback: if door_18 cannot be opened or path blocked, switch to an alternative exterior route if any exists, or search around exterior doors first.

  - [44] Open (if needed) and pass through door_18 to outside
  - [45] Locate compost_outside (if not yet observed) and move toward it
  - [46] Deposit onion into compost_outside

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. The first two actions (move to door_18 and pass through it) are concrete and unlock the next phase. The remaining step (45) appropriately handles the unknowns by locating compost_outside if needed, and step 46 provides a clear deposit action once there. A small caveat: if compost_outside remains unobserved, the plan should include a concrete search or a fallback deposit location.

Decision: Yes, start execution with
- [43] Move from (0.5,0) to door_18 (0.5,5.5)
- [44] Open (if needed) and pass through door_18 to outside
- [45] Locate compost_outside (if not observed) and move toward it
- [46] Deposit onion into compost_outside once at location

Be prepared to adapt if compost_outside isn’t found.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] Selected leaf task: [45] Locate compost_outside (if not yet observed) and move toward it

Reason: You are already outside, and compost_outside has not been observed. You should first locate it and then move toward it before depositing the onion (which would be [46]). Tasks [43] and [44] are no longer needed, and [46] requires knowing the compost_outside location.

[trial_imaginator] Naive single action:
- Go to door_18 (0.5, 5.5) along the hallway.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action
  - You moved along the hallway from (0.5,0) to (0.5,2.0). No other state changes.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_18: closed, unlocked at (0.5, 5.5)
  - Kitchen waste bin_32: (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds
  - Banana peel_30: basket_28 (0.5, 4.0); Paper scrap_31: basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber: (0.7, 3.8); Carrot: (2.8, 3.0); Radish: (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are in the hallway)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is now at (0.5,5.5) but still closed/unlocked
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - To progress toward outside, continue toward door_18 at (0.5,5.5) and open it if needed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- The plan aims to exit outside via door_18 at (0.5, 5.5). You are currently at (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway, door_18 is closed but unlocked. You still need to move up to y=5.5 and pass through/open the door. That target hasn’t been reached yet, so the plan is not completed.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed. Next step: continue moving along x=0.5 to y=5.5 and then open/pass through door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning (short):
- The plan aims to exit outside via door_18 at (0.5, 5.5). You are currently at (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway, door_18 is closed but unlocked. You still need to move up to y=5.5 and pass through/open the door. That target hasn’t been reached yet, so the plan is not completed.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed. Next step: continue moving along x=0.5 to y=5.5 and then open/pass through door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan intends to move from y=0 to y=2.0, but you are already at (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway. Executing that move would yield no state change and no progress toward door_18 at y=5.5. You need to continue from 2.0 up to 5.5 and then open door_18.

Answer: No

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan intends to move from y=0 to y=2.0, but you are already at (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway. Executing that move would yield no state change and no progress toward door_18 at y=5.5. You need to continue from 2.0 up to 5.5 and then open door_18.

Answer: No
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [47] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
The current plan tree has only a single high-level goal with no intermediate steps. To actually reach outside and deposit the onion, we must break it into concrete subgoals: approach and open door_18, move to outside, locate the compost outside, and deposit the onion. Without these steps, execution can stall at the doorway or fail to reach compost_outside.

Suggested decomposed plan (sufficient to start execution):
- [47.1] Move along the hallway from your current position (0.5, 2.0) to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5).
- [47.2] If door_18 is closed, open it (it is closed but unlocked, so this is a conditional step).
- [47.3] Move through door_18 to the outside.
- [47.4] Move from outside to the compost_outside location (tracking path as needed).
- [47.5] Deposit/drop onion from inventory into compost_outside.

If you want, I can tailor the coordinates for the path or add checks for each step.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan to achieve: Bring the onion into the compost outside.

Plan tree (concise updates):
- [47] Bring the onion into the compost outside
  - [47.1] Move along the hallway from current position (0.5, 2.0) to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5)
    - Precondition: path unobstructed; onion in inventory
    - Success: reach door_18 location
  - [47.2] Open door_18 (closed but unlocked) and pass through to outside
    - Precondition: door_18 is closed but unlocked
    - Success: outside area reached; door_18 remains open
  - [47.3] Locate compost_outside and navigate toward it
    - Precondition: outside area accessible; compost_outside may be unobserved initially
    - Success: reach vicinity of compost_outside
  - [47.4] Deposit onion into compost_outside
    - Precondition: onion in inventory
    - Success: onion placed in compost outside
  - [47.5] Confirm completion of goal
    - Precondition: onion successfully deposited

Concise pruning/adjustments:
- No pruning needed yet since door_18 is known to be closed but unlocked; proceed with opening as part of [47.2].
- If compost_outside location remains unobserved after [47.3], add a short exploratory subnode (e.g., search around the vicinity of the outside area) before 47.4.

Recommended next action:
- Proceed with [47.1] to door_18, then [47.2] to outside, followed by [47.3] and [47.4] to deposit the onion. I can execute these steps step-by-step and report progress after each. Confirm to proceed.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- No. The plan tree only has a single high-level goal and lacks concrete steps to reach outside and reach the compost location. To execute, you need subgoals for moving to door_18, opening it, going outside, locating compost_outside, and depositing the onion. Without these, execution could stall or be unsafe.

- 47.1 Move from current position (0.5, 2.0) to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5)
- 47.2 Open door_18 if it’s still closed (it’s closed but unlocked)
- 47.3 Move through door_18 to outside
- 47.4 Locate compost_outside (unknown coordinates)
- 47.5 Deposit onion into compost_outside (end state)

Notes:
- Onion remains in inventory; no automatic pickup expected.
- If compost_outside location is unknown, add an observation step to identify it before depositing.

Current plan tree:
- [47] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here’s a concise refinement of plan 47 for your goal “Bring the onion into the compost outside.”

Proposed plan decomposition
- 47 Bring the onion into the compost outside
  - 47.1 Move along the hallway to door_18 (0.5,2.0) → (0.5,5.5)
  - 47.2 If door_18 is closed, open it (door_18 is closed but unlocked)
  - 47.3 Pass through door_18 to outside
  - 47.4 Locate compost outside (search along the garden/outdoor path)
  - 47.5 Move onion from inventory to compost outside (deposit)

Pruning and pruning-guidance
- Prune 47.4 until compost outside is observed. If compost outside is not observed after reaching outside, keep 47.4 as a conditional: “continue searching until compost outside found.”
- If you want to simplify, you could merge 47.3 and 47.4 into a single step: “exit via door_18 and proceed along path until compost outside is found,” but only if you’re comfortable assuming the exterior route is a single continuous space.
- Do not prune 47.2 (opening door_18) since it’s closed but unlocked and required to reach outside.

Notes
- Onion remains in inventory (onion), so 47.5 will move it into the compost outside once you locate the compost.
- If you want, I can generate concrete preconditions/postconditions for each subtask to guide execution.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [47] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
  - [48] Move along the hallway to door_18 (0.5,2.0) → (0.5,5.5)
  - [49] If door_18 is closed, open it (door_18 is closed but unlocked)
  - [50] Pass through door_18 to outside
  - [51] Locate compost outside (search along the garden/outdoor path)
  - [52] Move onion from inventory to compost outside (deposit)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. 
- It has a clear sequence: move to door_18, open it if needed, pass through, go outside, locate compost, deposit onion. 
- Prerequisites are identified (door_18 is closed but unlocked; onion in inventory; distance to door_18 noted). 
- A reasonable contingency is included: open door if closed; then proceed to outside and search for compost.

Note: To improve robustness, consider adding simple failure guards, e.g., if door can't be opened or compost outside isn’t found after a short search, to handle unexpected obstacles.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] [48] Move along the hallway to door_18 (0.5,2.0) → (0.5,5.5)

Reason: This is the essential first step to reach door_18, opening the path to outside and enabling subsequent steps [49]-[52] to complete the deposit. Without moving to door_18, you cannot exit or access the compost outside.

[observer] New discoveries (short):
- Kitchen waste bin_32 contains 1 coffee grounds (coffee grounds_33) at position (0.2, 3.0).
- Your current position is (0.5, 2.0) in the hallway; hallway extend_y = 5.5. Distance to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) is 3.5 units along y.
- Door_18 is closed but unlocked at (0.5, 5.5) and is the route to outside (target for exit).
- Onion_3 remains in inventory (not new).

Plan:
Move along the hallway to door_18 (0.5,2.0) → (0.5,5.5)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive, human-only sequence to achieve the plan:

1) Move to door_18 along the hallway
- Action: Walk to coordinates (0.5, 5.5) in the hallway (arrive at door_18).

2) Open the door to exit
- Action: Open door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) (door_18 is closed but unlocked, so it will open).

Notes:
- Onion and onion_3 stay in inventory.
- No automatic pickups are expected.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action
  - You moved along the hallway from (0.5, 2.0) to (0.5, 3.0). No other state changes.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: (0.5, 3.0) in the hallway
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_18: closed, unlocked at (0.5, 5.5)
  - Kitchen waste bin_32: (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds
  - Banana peel_30: basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31: basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber: (0.7, 3.8); Carrot: (2.8, 3.0); Radish: (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you moved)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Position updated to (0.5, 3.0); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is currently closed/unopened (at its location)
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - Next step: continue toward door_18 (distance 2.5 units) and open it to exit.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Reason: The plan aims to move to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) and then open it to exit. You are currently at (0.5, 3.0) in the hallway, door_18 is closed but unlocked at (0.5, 5.5). You still need to move 2.5 units north to reach the door, and then perform an action to open it. Thus the objective (exit) has not been completed yet. 

Next steps: move to (0.5, 5.5), then open door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. Reason: The plan aims to move to door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) and then open it to exit. You are currently at (0.5, 3.0) in the hallway, door_18 is closed but unlocked at (0.5, 5.5). You still need to move 2.5 units north to reach the door, and then perform an action to open it. Thus the objective (exit) has not been completed yet. 

Next steps: move to (0.5, 5.5), then open door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: Recent steps show progress toward the goal—you've moved along the hallway toward door_18, reducing the distance (to 2.5 units) and remaining with door_18 closed but unlocked, so you can open and exit on arrival. There are no observed obstacles blocking the path, and onion_3 is still in inventory. The plan remains feasible, though you’ll need a separate action to open door_18 once you reach it.

Reason: Recent steps show progress toward the goal—you've moved along the hallway toward door_18, reducing the distance (to 2.5 units) and remaining with door_18 closed but unlocked, so you can open and exit on arrival. There are no observed obstacles blocking the path, and onion_3 is still in inventory. The plan remains feasible, though you’ll need a separate action to open door_18 once you reach it.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: Recent steps show progress toward the goal—you've moved along the hallway toward door_18, reducing the distance (to 2.5 units) and remaining with door_18 closed but unlocked, so you can open and exit on arrival. There are no observed obstacles blocking the path, and onion_3 is still in inventory. The plan remains feasible, though you’ll need a separate action to open door_18 once you reach it.

  - Right: Position updated to (0.5, 4.0); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 remains empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is currently closed/unopened at its location (distance 1.5)
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action; any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - Next step: move toward door_18 (1.5 units) and open it to exit.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed yet.

Reason: The plan is to exit via door_18 at (0.5, 5.5). You’re currently at (0.5, 4.0) with 1.5 units to go. You still need to move to door_18 and open it to actually exit. Once you reach (0.5, 5.5) and open the door, the plan would be finished. Onion remains in inventory, no automatic pickups expected.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed yet.

Reason: The plan is to exit via door_18 at (0.5, 5.5). You’re currently at (0.5, 4.0) with 1.5 units to go. You still need to move to door_18 and open it to actually exit. Once you reach (0.5, 5.5) and open the door, the plan would be finished. Onion remains in inventory, no automatic pickups expected.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- You’re currently at (0.5, 4.0) in the hallway with door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) unlocked but closed. Distance to the door is 1.5 units, so the next move directly toward door_18 progresses toward the exit.
- Past actions have shown you can move along the hallway; no state-change dead-ends or repeated futile actions are evident, and opening door_18 after arrival is feasible.
- Other doors (door_19, door_17) exist but don’t block the direct path to door_18.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next step: move to (0.5, 5.5) and open door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief):
- You’re currently at (0.5, 4.0) in the hallway with door_18 at (0.5, 5.5) unlocked but closed. Distance to the door is 1.5 units, so the next move directly toward door_18 progresses toward the exit.
- Past actions have shown you can move along the hallway; no state-change dead-ends or repeated futile actions are evident, and opening door_18 after arrival is feasible.
- Other doors (door_19, door_17) exist but don’t block the direct path to door_18.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next step: move to (0.5, 5.5) and open door_18 to exit.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,4.0) to (0.5,5.5)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Short reflection

- Effect of the action
  - You moved along the hallway from (0.5,4.0) to (0.5,5.5), arriving at door_18’s location. No door state change occurred during the move itself (opening the door is a separate action). Onion and onion_3 remain in inventory.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: at door_18 location (0.5,5.5)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_18: closed, unlocked at (0.5,5.5)
  - Kitchen waste bin_32: (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds
  - Banana peel_30: basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31: basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber: (0.7, 3.8); Carrot: (2.8, 3.0); Radish: (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are at door_18)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Position updated to door_18’s location; onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is now at its location and is closed/unopened
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (the door opening would be a separate action); any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - Next step: open door_18 to exit (or assess other routes).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning:
- The plan’s goal was to move along the hallway to door_18 and exit by opening it. You have arrived at door_18’s location, but the door is currently closed (though unlocked). Opening the door is a separate action required to exit, so the overall plan (exit the building) is not yet completed.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. You need to perform the action of opening door_18 to exit. Next steps: open door_18 and move outside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning:
- The plan’s goal was to move along the hallway to door_18 and exit by opening it. You have arrived at door_18’s location, but the door is currently closed (though unlocked). Opening the door is a separate action required to exit, so the overall plan (exit the building) is not yet completed.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. You need to perform the action of opening door_18 to exit. Next steps: open door_18 and move outside.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan to move along the hallway to door_18 has been completed; you’re now at door_18 (0.5, 5.5). The next required action is to open door_18 to exit, and it is closed but unlocked, so this is feasible. There are no conflicting observations or repeat-actions that negate progress.

Decision: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next step: open door_18 to exit.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan to move along the hallway to door_18 has been completed; you’re now at door_18 (0.5, 5.5). The next required action is to open door_18 to exit, and it is closed but unlocked, so this is feasible. There are no conflicting observations or repeat-actions that negate progress.

Decision: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next step: open door_18 to exit.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] opened door_18
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action
  - Action opened door_18. No movement occurred in this action.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: still at door_18 location (0.5, 5.5) in the hallway
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_18: open at (0.5, 5.5)
  - Kitchen waste bin_32: (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds
  - Banana peel_30: basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31: basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are at door_18)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Position updated to door_18’s location; onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is now open
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (opening the door, not onion); any automatic pickup occurred

- Note
  - Next step: pass through door_18 to exit, or reassess other routes.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Brief reasoning:
- The plan aimed to move along x=0.5 from y=2.0 to y=5.5 to reach door_18. You have indeed reached door_18’s location, and the door is open/unlocked, so the movement portion is complete.
- If the overall goal includes exiting through door_18, you still need to pass through the door. That action is not completed yet.

Verdict: Movement part completed; exiting part pending.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Brief reasoning:
- The plan aimed to move along x=0.5 from y=2.0 to y=5.5 to reach door_18. You have indeed reached door_18’s location, and the door is open/unlocked, so the movement portion is complete.
- If the overall goal includes exiting through door_18, you still need to pass through the door. That action is not completed yet.

Verdict: Movement part completed; exiting part pending.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.

Reasoning:
- The stated plan aimed to move from (0.5, 2.0) to (0.5, 5.5) to reach door_18. Recent updates show you are already at door_18 (0.5, 5.5) and door_18 is open/unlocked, so the goal of reaching the door is achieved.
- The next sensible action is to exit by passing through door_18. Continuing to move along the hallway would not progress toward a new objective and would be redundant.
- There are no new obstacles preventing exit, so the plan should shift to exiting rather than moving to door_18 again.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No.

Reasoning:
- The stated plan aimed to move from (0.5, 2.0) to (0.5, 5.5) to reach door_18. Recent updates show you are already at door_18 (0.5, 5.5) and door_18 is open/unlocked, so the goal of reaching the door is achieved.
- The next sensible action is to exit by passing through door_18. Continuing to move along the hallway would not progress toward a new objective and would be redundant.
- There are no new obstacles preventing exit, so the plan should shift to exiting rather than moving to door_18 again.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [53] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not yet sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The current plan has a single goal without the required substeps: we first need to exit through door_18 to reach outside, then locate the compost outside (location not yet observed), and finally deposit the onion there (removing it from inventory). Without these concrete steps, execution could stall or misplace the onion.

Suggested decomposed plan:
- [53] Bring the onion into the compost outside.
  - [53.1] Exit through door_18 to outside.
  - [53.2] Move toward compost_outside location (or search along the exterior if location unknown).
  - [53.3] Deposit onion into compost_outside (remove onion from inventory).
  - [53.4] Confirm onion is deposited and inventory updated.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan for goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside

Proposed plan tree (concise updates)
- [53] Bring the onion into the compost outside
  - [53.1] Exit to outside via door_18 (door_18 is open/unlocked)
  - [53.2] Locate compost_outside after exiting; if observed, move toward it
  - [53.3] Deposit onion from inventory into compost_outside (onion location becomes compost_outside; inventory no longer contains onion)
  - [53.4] Verify onion is inside compost_outside and update status
  - [53.5] End or proceed with next objective

Concise pruning and refinement suggestions
- Prune 53.2 if you want a one-shot exit plan: you can assume you’ll encounter a compost hector outside and proceed directly to 53.3 after exiting. If compost_outside isn’t observed, you can loop back to 53.2 with a broader search.
- If you prefer to keep steps minimal: combine 53.1 and 53.2 into a single action trigger (exit and immediately search for compost_outside), then proceed to 53.3.

State impact notes (for execution)
- After 53.1: position becomes outside; onion in inventory; door_18 remains open.
- After 53.3: onion moves from inventory to compost_outside; onion_3 remains in inventory.
- After 53.4: onion confirmed in compost_outside; plan complete.

If you want, I can tailor the exact action wording for each step (e.g., “exit via door_18” vs “step outside,” and “drop onion into compost_outside”) to fit the action vocabulary you’re using.

Goal: Bring the onion into the compost outside.
Current plan tree:
- [53] Bring the onion into the compost outside. (current focus)
  - [54] Exit to outside via door_18 (door_18 is open/unlocked)
  - [55] Locate compost_outside after exiting; if observed, move toward it

  - [57] Verify onion is inside compost_outside and update status
  - [58] End or proceed with next objective

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- The goal is clear and concrete: exit via open door_18, locate compost_outside, deposit the onion, and verify. 
- The plan breaks this into sequential, actionable steps with a built-in contingency (55) to search for compost_outside if not observed. 
- Onion is in inventory and available for deposit; door_18 is open, making exit feasible. 
- A minor improvement would be explicitly handling the case where compost_outside isn’t observed after exiting (expand search or recheck nearby areas), but the current steps already cover that idea.

Decision:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended next action:
- Proceed with [54] Exit to outside via door_18. After exiting, follow [55] to locate compost_outside and then [56] to deposit the onion, followed by [57] verification. If compost_outside isn’t observed, use [55]’s guidance to continue exploring toward potential outside compost locations.

- Action: Go through door_18 to outside. 
- Preconditions: Door_18 is open and unlocked (true in this state).
- Postconditions: You are outside; inventory unchanged ([onion]); onion_3 still in inventory.

[user] Plan:
Exit to outside via door_18 (door_18 is open/unlocked)
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_18 into office
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of the action
  - You passed through door_18 from the hallway into the office. No inventory changes. Door_18 remains open/unlocked.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: inside the office (exact coordinates not specified)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Table_2: empty
  - Door_23: open
  - Door_15: open
  - Door_14: closed, unlocked
  - Door_18: open (on the office side)
  - Kitchen waste bin_32: (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds
  - Banana peel_30: basket_28 (0.5, 4.0)
  - Paper scrap_31: basket_29 (3.5, 1.0)
  - Cucumber: (0.7, 3.8); Carrot: (2.8, 3.0); Radish: (1.2, 1.2)
  - Chairs: chair_44 (1.0, 3.5); chair_45 (0.0, 4.5)
  - Compost_outside: not observed

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you are in the office)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Inside the office now; onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Table_2 empty; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is open
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (opening the door was the action, not the onion); any automatic pickup

- Note
  - Next steps could be to continue exploring the office, re-evaluate routes, or plan exit via other doors if desired.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short answer: Not yet completed.

Reasoning:
- The goal was to exit via door_18. Door_18 is open/unlocked and you are at (0.5, 0) (the door location) inside the office.
- However, you have not yet performed the action of stepping through the door. The plan is achieved only after you actually pass through to the outside.

Next step: Step through door_18 to exit. Once done, you’ll be outside (inventory unchanged, onion_3 still in inventory).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short answer: Not yet completed.

Reasoning:
- The goal was to exit via door_18. Door_18 is open/unlocked and you are at (0.5, 0) (the door location) inside the office.
- However, you have not yet performed the action of stepping through the door. The plan is achieved only after you actually pass through to the outside.

Next step: Step through door_18 to exit. Once done, you’ll be outside (inventory unchanged, onion_3 still in inventory).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.

Reasoning:
- The latest state shows door_18 is open/unlocked at your current location (0.5,0) inside the office, so you can exit immediately with no state changes needed.
- There are no reported obstacles blocking the doorway, and you’d complete the exit step right away. 
- After exiting, you can plan the next step (e.g., bringing the onion to the compost outside) from outside.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.

Reasoning:
- The latest state shows door_18 is open/unlocked at your current location (0.5,0) inside the office, so you can exit immediately with no state changes needed.
- There are no reported obstacles blocking the doorway, and you’d complete the exit step right away. 
- After exiting, you can plan the next step (e.g., bringing the onion to the compost outside) from outside.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_18 into hallway
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Reflection of the performed action

- Effect of the action
  - You passed through door_18 from the office into the hallway. No inventory changes. Door_18 remains open/unlocked.

- Current facts
  - Agent position: in the hallway at (0.5, 0) (exit path not yet taken)
  - Inventory: [onion]
  - Onion_3 location: in inventory
  - Door_18: open/unlocked at the doorway between office and hallway
  - Other relevant items (brief): kitchen waste bin_32 has 1 coffee grounds at (0.2, 3.0); shelf_41 with apple_42 and apple_43 in the office

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You would still be at onion location after the action: false (you moved into the hallway)
  - Onion would be moved/sliced/opened by this action: false
  - No automatic pickup occurred during the move: true

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Position updated to the hallway (0.5, 0); onion remains in inventory; onion_3 remains in inventory; Door_14 unchanged; Door_15 remains open; Door_23 remains open; Door_18 is now open/unlocked
  - Wrong: Being at the onion’s original location after the action; onion being moved/opened by this action (opening the door was the action, not the onion); any automatic pickup

- Note
  - Next step options: exit outside via door_18 (when you choose to) or explore other doors along the hallway.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - New observations (facts verified):
  - You are at the door_18 location (0.5, 5.5) in the hallway; door_18 is open and unlocked.
  - New doors along the hallway:
    - door_19 at (1.0, 4.5): closed but unlocked
    - door_17 at (0.0, 4.5): closed but unlocked
    - door_21 at (1.0, 2.5): closed but unlocked
  - Door_23 remains open; Door_15 remains open; Door_14 remains closed/unlocked
  - Kitchen waste bin_32 at (0.2, 3.0) contains 1 coffee grounds (coffee grounds_33)
  - Onion_3 remains in inventory

- Relevance for plan:
  - Primary exit via door_18 is available (you’re at the exit doorway now).
  - The newly observed doors provide alternative routes if needed (19, 17, 21).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed yet.

Reason: The plan requires you to step through door_18 to the outside. You are currently at the door and it is open/unlocked, but the action of moving outside has not been executed. Once you pass through door_18, the plan is completed (you’ve exited). After that, you can proceed with bringing the onion to the compost outside if that’s still desired.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed yet.

Reason: The plan requires you to step through door_18 to the outside. You are currently at the door and it is open/unlocked, but the action of moving outside has not been executed. Once you pass through door_18, the plan is completed (you’ve exited). After that, you can proceed with bringing the onion to the compost outside if that’s still desired.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You are already at door_18 (0.5, 5.5) in the hallway, and its state is open/unlocked. Exiting would be a single immediate action with no reported blockers or needed state changes.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Exit through door_18 to outside now.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: You are already at door_18 (0.5, 5.5) in the hallway, and its state is open/unlocked. Exiting would be a single immediate action with no reported blockers or needed state changes.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Exit through door_18 to outside now.
