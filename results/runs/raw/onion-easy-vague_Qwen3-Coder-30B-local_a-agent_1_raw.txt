[observer] I observe an onion on a table in the living room. The onion is at position (3,3.25) on table_2. 

The relevant discovery is that the onion is located on the table, which is in the living room where I currently am. This confirms the onion is accessible for the task of bringing it to the compost outside.

- Door_15 leads to outside/compost area
- Can proceed through open door

**Assumptions proven wrong:**
- None - the action was successful as expected

**New state:** Agent is outside in hallway, ready to proceed to compost area with onion.

[observer] I observe:

The relevant discovery is that door_15 is the correct exit to the compost area and is open, so I can proceed directly outside with the onion.

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**
- Went through door_15 into hallway

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in hallway (outside living room)
- Onion_3 is in agent's inventory
- Door_15 is open

**Assumptions proven right:**
- Door_15 leads to outside/compost area
- Can proceed through open door

**Assumptions proven wrong:**
- None - the action was successful as expected

**New state:** Agent is outside in hallway, ready to proceed to compost area with onion.

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**
- Went through door_15 into hallway

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in hallway (outside living room)
- Onion_3 is in agent's inventory

- Door_15 leads to outside/compost area
- Can proceed through open door

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Action Effect:** Went through door_15 into living_room

**Facts:**
- Agent is now in living_room
- Onion_3 is in agent's inventory  
- Door_15 is open

**Assumptions:**
- Door_15 leads to living_room (corrected from compost area assumption)
- Door_15 leads to outside/compost area

**Proved Right:** Door_15 leads to living_room
**Proved Wrong:** Assumption that door_15 leads to compost area (it actually leads to living_room)

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I observe:
- I am in living_room at position (4, 1.75)
- Door_15 is open and unlocked at position (4, 1.75)
- Onion_3 is in my inventory

The relevant discovery is that Door_15 is open, which means I can proceed through it to the outside area where the compost is located. This verifies the path to my goal is accessible.

[observer] I observe:
- I am in the hallway at position (0, 1.75)
- Onion_3 is in my inventory
- Door_15 is open and unlocked at position (0, 1.75)
- Door_15 leads to the outside area where the compost is located

The relevant discovery is that Door_15 is open, confirming I can proceed through it to reach the compost area.
