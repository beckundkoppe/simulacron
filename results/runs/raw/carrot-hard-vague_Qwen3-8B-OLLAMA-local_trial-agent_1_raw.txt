Goal: Place the carrot on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [15] Place the carrot on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal "Place the carrot on the table" requires subtasks like locating the carrot, picking it up, navigating to the table, and putting it down. Without these decomposed steps, the plan lacks actionable instructions for the agent to execute. 

**Answer:** No, the plan needs decomposition into subtasks (e.g., "Pick up the carrot," "Go to the table," "Put the carrot on the table") before execution can proceed.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. It lacks steps to locate the carrot, move to its position, and ensure the table is accessible. A complete plan would require:  
1. **Find carrot** (locate it in the environment).  
2. **Move to carrot** (navigate to its position).  
3. **Pick up carrot**.  
4. **Move to table**.  
5. **Place carrot on table**.  

The original plan assumes the carrot is already in hand and the table is directly accessible, which may not hold. Thus, execution cannot start without these additional steps.  

**Answer:** No, the plan tree is incomplete and requires decomposition into movement and object interaction steps.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The Plan is completed. The carrot was already in the inventory, and the action of placing it on the table was successfully executed. The "Pick up carrot" step was redundant since the carrot was already held. The task is done, so the plan is complete.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Drop the carrot on table_3.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
