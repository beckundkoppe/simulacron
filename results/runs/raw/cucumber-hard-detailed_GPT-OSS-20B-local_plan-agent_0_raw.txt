**Assumptions made**

3. *The table is at (3.5, 0.5).* – **Correct**.  

**What proved right / wrong**

- The assumption that the cucumber’s location was correct held true.  
- The assumption that the cucumber would be picked up after moving to its location proved false; the cucumber remains on the floor.  
- The assumption about the table’s location also held true.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- Human moved to (3.5, 1.5).  
- No pick‑up or placement was executed.

**Current facts**

- Human is at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Cucumber remains on the floor at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and empty.  
- Human is not holding the cucumber.

**Assumptions made**

1. Cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Table is at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. Moving to the cucumber’s location automatically picks it up.

**Assumptions proved**

- **Right**: Cucumber’s location is correct.  
- **Right**: Table’s location is correct.  
- **Wrong**: Moving to the cucumber does not automatically pick it up; the pick‑up step was omitted.  

No new facts were discovered.
