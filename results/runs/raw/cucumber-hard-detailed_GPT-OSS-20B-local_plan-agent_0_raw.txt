[reflector] **Facts after the action**

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) |

No objects have been moved or altered; the cucumber remains on the floor at its original spot, and the table is still at (3.5, 0.5).

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber is indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The table is at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. The path from the human’s start position (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5) is unobstructed.  
4. The human is not already holding any object.  

**Which assumptions held true**

- The cucumber’s location was correct.  
- The table’s location was correct.  
- The movement to (3.5, 1.5) succeeded, implying no obstacles.  
- The human was free‑handed (not carrying anything).  

**Which assumptions remain unverified**

- The cucumber is still present and not hidden or moved by another agent.  
- The table is still accessible for placing the cucumber.  

**Next minimal actions**

1. Pick up the cucumber.  
2. Move to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. Place the cucumber on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
