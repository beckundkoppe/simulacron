1. *The human could travel directly to (3.5, 1) without obstruction.* – **Proved correct**; the move succeeded.  
2. *No objects would be displaced by the movement.* – **Proved correct**; all objects stayed in place.  
3. *The human’s inventory would remain unchanged.* – **Proved correct**; still empty.  

No other assumptions were needed for this single action. The next step will be to pick up the peppers (starting with the one now under the human).

[reflector] **Facts after the move (3.0 m → 3.5 m, 1.5 m → 0.5 m)**  
- **Human position:** (3.5 m, 0.5 m) – now standing at the table.  
- **Inventory:** still holds *pepper_5*, *pepper_3*, *pepper_4*.  
- **Objects in the room:**  
  • *table_6* at (3.5 m, 0.5 m), still empty (no peppers placed on it).  
  • No other objects remain on the floor.

**Assumptions made before the move**  

| # | Assumption | Verdict |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | The path from (3.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 0.5) is unobstructed. | ✅ proved correct – the move succeeded. |
| 2 | Moving does not move any held items or other objects. | ✅ proved correct – all three peppers remain in inventory; the table stayed put. |
| 3 | The inventory remains unchanged during locomotion. | ✅ proved correct – still three peppers, none added or dropped. |
| 4 | No hidden constraints (doors, weight limits, etc.) affect the move. | ✅ proved correct – no interference observed. |

All assumptions held; the state is now as listed above.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “drop pepper_5 into table_6”**

| **Human position** | (3.5 m, 0.5 m) – unchanged |
| **Human inventory** | Holds *pepper_3* and *pepper_4* (pepper_5 has been removed) |

**Assumptions made for this action**

| # | Assumption | Verdict |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | The human can drop an item while standing exactly at the same coordinates as the target container (the table). | ✅ proved correct – pepper_5 was successfully placed on the table. |
| 2 | The table can accept/hold a pepper (i.e., it is a valid container). | ✅ proved correct – pepper_5 is now on the table. |
| 3 | Dropping an item removes it from the inventory and does not affect any other objects. | ✅ proved correct – inventory now lacks pepper_5 and no other objects moved. |
| 4 | The human’s position and other objects remain unchanged during the drop. | ✅ proved correct – human stays at (3.5, 0.5) and the table stays at (3.5, 0.5). |
