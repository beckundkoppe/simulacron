| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. **Moving to the cucumber is a necessary first step** – this was correct; the human is now at the cucumber’s location.  
2. **The cucumber would be on the table after the move** – this was incorrect; the cucumber remains where it was.

**Result**

The action achieved the intermediate assumption (human at cucumber) but did not accomplish the goal of placing the cucumber on the table. The cucumber is still not on the table.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3.5,1.5) to table_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and is now standing on the cucumber.  
- No pick‑up or placement was executed, so the cucumber remains at (3.5, 1.5) and is **not** on the table.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) stays empty.

**Current facts**
