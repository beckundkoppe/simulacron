content='This seems quite complex at first glance. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, I need to collect all the peppers in the room. From my perception, there are three peppers: pepper_3 (at (3.5,1.5)), pepper_4 (at (3.0,1.5)), and pepper_5 (at (3.5,1.0)). Since I\'m already at pepper_4\'s position, I can collect it first.\n\nBut wait, the current position is (3.0, 1.5), which is exactly on top of pepper_2! So let\'s change this order:\n\n1. Collect pepper_4.\n2. Move to pepper_5\'s position and collect it.\n3. Move to pepper_3\'s position and collect it.\n\nAfter collecting all peppers, I need to place them on the table at (3.5, 0.5).\n\nLet\'s plan the actions:\n- First, collect pepper_4\n- Next, move to pepper_5 at (3.5,1.2)\n   - But looking at my current position is (3.0, 1.5), which is west of pepper_5\'s north-south aligned positions.\n\nWait, I\'m currently at (3, 1.5). To get to pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0), I\'ll need to move south-east. But first, let\'s collect the Pepper right in front of me (pepper_4).\n\nThen, to reach pepper_5:\n- First go down to y=1.2\n- Then go right to x=3.6\n\nBut looking at the positions:\n\nCurrent position: (3.0, 1.5)\nPepper 4 is at (3.0,1.5) - same as current position, so we can pick it up first.\n\nThen next pepper_5 is south by one unit and east by 0.5 at (3.5,1.0).\n\nPepper_3: is further north at (3.5,1.5)\n\nSo revised order:\n1. Pick up pepper_4 at current position (3.0,1.5)\n2. Move to (3.5,1.0) and pick up pepper_5\n3. Move to (3.5,1.5) and pick up pepper_3\n\nBut first we need the initial step: Pick up pepper_4 since it\'s at current location.\n\nNow, looking at the available actions:\nWe have move_to_position, but no take() function defined in the schema. Hmm, perhaps I need to use take_from where \'from_id\' is \'FLOOR\'.\n\nLet me see:\n\nAvailable functions:\n- move_to_position\n- move_to_object\n- take_from (item from object or floor)\n- drop_to (item into/onto object or floor)\n- interact_with_object\n- interact_with_object_using_item\n\nThe current position has pepper_4 on the "floor", so to pick it up, we\'d use:\ntake_from(what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR")\n\nBut first I need to confirm if that\'s correct. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the state representation:\n- your_inventory\n- your_perception: list of objects/items in the room with their positions\n\nYes, objects not associated with an inventory or container are on the floor.\n\nSo to pick up pepper_4 which is at position (3.0,1.5) where I currently am, I should use take_from with from_id="FLOOR".\n\nThen for movement:\nI\'m at (3.0,1.5), need to go to (3.5,1.0):\n\nThis requires moving SE.\n\nFirst south to y=1.2, then southeast to x=3.4,3.5, and y down to 1.0.\n\nBut the function move_to_position(x,y) seems suitable for this.\nBut first I need to confirm if it\'s possible to move in any direction, but looking at the problem, movement is within these coordinates only.\n\nSo pathing:\nCurrent: (3.0,1.5)\nTarget1: (3.5,1.0)\nMove down: decrease y to 1.0 (move south)\nBut need to avoid obstacles, though there aren\'t any mentioned except other items which we can move through, presumably.\n\nSo the path is straight SOUTH first:\nFrom (3.0,1.5) -> (3.0,1.4) -> ... -> (3.0, 1.0)\nBut pepper 5 is at x=3.5 when y=1.0. So we need to move east after reaching y=1.0.\n\nAlternatively move diagonally, but move_to_position can directly take us to the target in one step.\n\nSo first action: take_from(what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR")\nThen move_to_position(x="3.5", y="1.0")\nThen take_from(what_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR")\n\nNext we need pepper 3 at (3.5,1.5)\nSo move north to y=1.2, and then east if necessary but same x already.\n\nWait (3.5,1.0) to (3.5,1.5):\nmove_to_position(x="3.5", y="1.5")\nthen take_from(what_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR")\n\nNow we have all peppers in inventory.\nNow move to table at (3.5,0.5)\nmove_to_position(x="3.5", y="0.5")\nAnd drop all peppers onto the table.\n\nBut the problem says "drop them on the table" - not sure if it\'s allowed to drop multiple items at once or must be one by one. The \'drop_to\' function suggests one item at a time, but the task doesn\'t specify order so any order is fine.\n\nBut wait, I need to verify the functions again. The initial \'take_from\' may indeed require that we\'re nearby the object (\'FLOOR\' in this case), i.e., at the same position as the item or close enough. But since pepper_4 is exactly at my current position (3.0,1.5) I think it\'s picked up correctly without needing to move.\n\nBut for pepper_5 and pepper_3: am I "nearby" when moving directly to their positions?\n\nThe problem statement doesn\'t specify proximity requirements for take_from. Assuming that move_to_position brings us exactly to the target position (x,y), then if an item is at (x,y) we can pick it up using take_from(..., from_id="FLOOR").\n\nSimilarly to drop, when at table\'s position, drop peppers onto it one by one.\n\nSo complete sequence:\n1. take pepper_4\n2. move to pepper 5\'s position, take pepper_5\n3. move to pepper 3\'s position, take pepper_3\n4. move to table\n5. drop peppers onto table (one at a time)\n\nBut the task is: collect ALL peppers first, then place on table.\n\nImplementing:\n\nStep1: Take pepper_4\n```json\n{\n  "action": "take_from",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_4",\n    "from_id": "FLOOR"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow inventory has pepper_4\n\nStep2: Move to (3.5,1.0) for pepper_5\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "arguments": {\n    "x": "3.5",\n    "y": "1.0"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep3: Take pepper_5\n```json\n{\n  "action": "take_from",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_5",\n    "from_id": "FLOOR"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow inventory has pepper_4 and pepper_5\n\nStep4: Move to (3.5,1.5) for pepper_4 [Wait no, pepper_3 is at (3.5,1.5)]\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "arguments": {\n    "x": "3.5",\n    "y": "1.5"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep5: Take pepper_3\n```json\n{\n  "action": "take_from",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_3",\n    "from_id": "FLOOR"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow all peppers are in inventory.\n\nStep6: Move to table at (3.5,0.5)\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "arguments": {\n    "x": "3.5",\n    "y": "0.5"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep7: Drop pepper_4 onto table\n```json\n{\n  "action": "drop_to",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_4",\n    "to_id": "table_6"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep8: Drop pepper_5 onto table\n```json\n{\n  "action": "drop_to",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_5",\n    "to_id": "table_6"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep9: Drop pepper_3 onto table\n```json\n{\n  "action": "drop_to",\n  "arguments": {\n    "what_id": "pepper_3",\n    "to_id": "table_6"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we\'re done.\n\nBut looking back - first step is to move to the position if not adjacent, but in initial state we are at pepper_4\'s position (assuming based on the initial state where your_pos is (3.0,1.5) and pepper_4 is at that exact location). Wait, no: the initial state shows pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5), which matches current position, so we can pick it up immediately without moving first.\n\nThus revised action sequence:\n\nAction 1: Pick up pepper_4:\n```json\n{"action": "take_from", "arguments": {"what_id": "pepper_4", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n```\n\n(Now inventory has pepper_4)\n\nAction 2: Move to pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0):\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_position", "arguments": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.0"}}\n```\n\nAction 3: Pick up pepper_5:\n```json\n{"action": "take_from", "arguments": {"what_id": "pepper_5", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n```\n\n(Now inventory has pepper_4 and pepper_5)\n\nAction 4: Move to pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5):\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "arguments": {"object_id": "table_6"}} wait no that\'s for moving to objects, not coordinates.\n\nWait, we have two move options:\n- move_to_position(x,y)\n- move_to_object(object_id)\n\nSince pepper_3 is at position (3.5,1.5), we\'d use move_to_position\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_position", "arguments": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}}\n```\n\nAction 5: Pick up pepper_3:\n```json\n{"action": "take_from", "arguments": {"what_id": "pepper_3", "from_id": "FLOOR"}}\n```\n\n(Now all peppers are in inventory)\n\nAction 6: Move to table at (3.5,0.5) [but table is position not an object to move_to_object]:\nWait - how do we know objects and their locations? The initial state shows the table\'s position isn\'t directly given, but looking back:\n\nInitial your_perception:\ncontains item with id and position like:\n"pepper_3": {"position": (3.5,1.5), ...}\n"table_6": ?\n\nWait, reviewing initial problem statement: it lists objects in perception but positions were not given for all; perhaps the table is at some known reference point.\n\nBut original problem says: "drop them on the table". The initial state shows a \'container\' or similar? Wait let\'s see full initial representation again:\n\nFrom initial problem:\n- your_pos: (3.0, 1.5)\n- your_inventory: empty\n- your_perception:\n  - items/objs at positions like:\n    pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5)\n    pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0)\n    pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5)\n    presumably table is also listed with its position\n\nAh, looking back - in the initial state representation you provided, it should include all items and their positions including the table. In the current \'state\' for this action, I don\'t see it so assuming based on original problem statement where the task says to place peppers "on the table" which is presumably a specific location.\n\nBut since in yourperception there\'s no table info shown here, perhaps table position is fixed/known or not needed if we\'re moving to it via object_id. Wait, looking at available actions: move_to_object(object_id) is available. So if we know the object_id of table (likely \'table\', \'table_1\' etc.) but not given in the partial state.\n\nGiven original problem mentions "the table", likely its id is known/implied to be \'table\'. But in actions available we\'d need correct object ID. Since initial state isn\'t fully shown, perhaps assume it\'s referable as \'table\'.\n\nBut since move_to_position exists and table position may not be fixed, but problem implies reaching the table\'s location which must be known or inferable. In absence of table position in initial state for this instance, and given original problem description doesn\'t specify coordinates - perhaps we must use move_to_object if table is referenced as an object name.\n\nBut in your_perception, items are listed by their ids and positions, e.g.,:\npepper_4 at (3.5,...), so likely table is also listed there like table at some x,y or perhaps it\'s treated differently.\n\nGiven that the available actions allow moving to a position directly, if we had tables\' coordinates. But since they\'re not provided in this interaction\'s initial state, perhaps we must assume the table is an object you can move_to via its id (like \'table_6\'), but need confirmation on its ID.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps initial your_perception was truncated and does include the table at some position like other items are listed. But as presented here missing that info so will assume table\'s position is given/known when fully specified - for this example\'s sake assume we can locate table by moving to its coordinates if they were part of initial state.\n\nBut since in the action plan above, step8 move_to_position(3.5,0.5) was a guess but not confirmed - this may fail since table position isn\'t provided here.\n\nAlternative: if table is an object with known ID like \'table_6\' then we\'d use:\nmove_to_object {"object_id": "table_6"}\n\nSo correcting step to reach table would depend on whether we know its ID and if located via move_to_object or position (if pos was known).\n\nGiven uncertainty here - likely in original full state representation the table\'s details are specified. For this answer, proceed assuming as in initial version where we knew table at some coord like (x,y)=(3.5,0.5), hence steps above would work. But strictly, without seeing table\'s position or ID, can\'t specify accurate move command to reach it.\n\nGiven available actions and partial state info - likely the correct step is:\n\nAction 6: "move_to_object" {"object_id": "table"} (or whatever its id is; assuming \'table\' for this example)\n\nThen drop each pepper onto the table:\ne.g.,\ndrop_to(what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table")\n\n---\n\nFinal action sequence, assuming table object ID is known and movement to objects directly is possible:\n\n1. `take_from`: take pepper_4 from FLOOR\n2. `move_to_position`: go to (3.5, 1.0)\n3. `take_from`: take pepper_5 from FLOOR\n4. `move_to_position`: go to (3.5, 1.5)\n5. `take_from`: take pepper_3 from FLOOR\n6. `move_to_object`: move to table by object ID (e.g., "table")\n7. `drop_to`: drop pepper_4 onto table\n8. `drop_to`: drop pepper_5 onto table\n9. `drop_to`: drop pepper_3 onto table\n\nBut more accurately if we assume the table\'s position is at (x=3.5,y=0.5) as I initially guessed based on pepper positions being in that locality, then step steps 2 and onwards would be correct using move_to_position with respective coordinates.\n\nHowever given that the actual initial full state wasn\'t provided here (like full you_perception list), and assuming table is at a position not specified - this is incomplete. In practice you\'d need to see the full initial game state representation including all object positions, IDs etc. to program actions accurately.\n\nBut since original problem doesn\'t provide full initial state for this instance - likely it expects general approach which can be instantiated with real coordinates from actual game state.\n\nThus final answer: implement the sequence of move and pick up actions as above, substituting correct table coordinates/object reference based on visible environment state representation that includes table\'s position/ID.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3805, 'prompt_tokens': 3693, 'total_tokens': 7498, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-456', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019afefe-ff86-7733-8ed2-c4a7025c98cf-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3693, 'output_tokens': 3805, 'total_tokens': 7498, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='Since no specific goal is provided, the most logical next action without additional context would be to interact with an object in proximity.\n\nThe chest (`chest_7`) is already open and unlocked, so if the goal were to close it or put something inside, that could be done.

content='**Summary**: With no specific task given and adhering to minimality, the optimal action is to wait (no operation). However - since we are directly adjacent to `chest_7` which contains unknown items- a minimal viable operation could be to open it if that’s inferred as necessary. But since the instruction specifies minimal and only what is requested, and nothing has been requested, the correct response is empty operation.\n\nThus, an empty response array:\n\n```\n[]\n```\n\nBut syntactically, this is invalid for toolcalls in most APIs (which expect either a valid call or error; emptiness not being standard). Therefore, the theoretically most compliant output under constraints is:\n\n`` (empty line)\n\nHowever - to strictly follow JSON format with NO OPERATION, we may have to emit an empty list in context where no functions are available as tool calls, represented thusly but this is non-standard practice for function-based interaction protocols.\n\n**Final Executable Answer**:\n```json\n[]\n```\n\nBut if the API or system expects non-empty responses under all scenarios (even when no operation), then the next minimal action could be to review inventory, though that wasn\'t asked. Given the instruction strictly asks only for what\'s best "explicitly" and nothing has been tasked - empty is correct where allowed.\n\nFor absolute compliance where NO OPERATION must still return something:\n\nOne could argue to take `pepper_3` from the floor as it was observed but not tasked. However, since not asked for, this exceeds minimal scope. The accurate response in absence of goals is no action. For the purpose this exercise\'s requirement to "only consist of toolcalls" (even if empty), we output empty array notation.\n\n(Note: In practical agent systems without explicit idle state protocols, this case would likely require re-prompting for tasks or goals.)\n\nThus:\n\n**Executable Minimal Response**:\n```json\n[]\n```\n\nBut this is technically not a valid single "tool call". Forced to pick minimal actual operation instead of emptiness: inventory check or no-op like moving to same position. But the latter is invalid (no movement). Thus, the zero-cost, most minimal is empty call set.\n\nFinal answer as per constraints:\n\n```json\n[]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 459, 'prompt_tokens': 3858, 'total_tokens': 4317, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-611', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019aff03-45cd-7ce2-87d2-2ec0f4d7b58f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3858, 'output_tokens': 459, 'total_tokens': 4317, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
