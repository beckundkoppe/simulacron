Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the attempted action**

- No action was actually carried out because the human could not find a potato to pick up.  
- The table remains unchanged (no object on it).  
- The human remains in the same location, still holding nothing.

**Facts in the new state**

1. There is no potato in the environment.  
2. The table is empty.  
3. The human is still in the same place, holding nothing.

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Status | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| A potato exists in the room | **Wrong** | The system reported “No potato is present.” |
| The table is available for placing objects | **Right** | The table was empty, but this fact was irrelevant because the object was missing. |
| The human can place an object on the table | **Conditional** | The action would have succeeded if the potato existed; the limitation was the missing object, not the human’s ability. |

**Summary**

The attempted “place potato on table” action had no effect because the prerequisite object (potato) was absent. All other environmental facts remain unchanged.

| The key, box, and table remain unchanged | **Right** | No interactions were performed. |
| The human holds nothing | **Right** | No pick‑up or drop action occurred. |

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (4.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 1.0).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or otherwise interacted with.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at (3.0, 1.0).  
2. Key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
3. Door at (4.0, 4.0) is open and unlocked.  
4. Box at (1.0, 1.0) still contains the diamond.  
5. Table at (0.0, 4.0) is empty.  
6. Human holds nothing.

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Status | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Human can move to (3.0, 1.0) | **Right** | The move succeeded. |
| Key remains at (3.0, 1.0) | **Right** | No interaction occurred. |
| No other objects changed | **Right** | No pick‑up/drop or other actions were performed. |

All assumptions proved correct; the only change in the environment is the human’s new location.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- The human moved to the box at (1, 1) while holding the key.  
- The diamond inside the box was collected.  
- The box is now empty.  
- No other objects were moved or altered.

**Current facts**

| Fact | Value |

| Human position | (1.0, 1.0) |

| Box at (1.0, 1.0) | empty |
| Table at (0.0, 4.0) | empty |
| Door at (4.0, 4.0) | open & unlocked |
| Potato | absent |

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Status | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| key_7 existed at (3, 1) | **Right** | Key was present and picked up. |
| diamond_5 existed in the box | **Right** | Diamond was reported inside the box. |
| diamond_5 could be collected | **Right** | Collection succeeded. |
| box_6 becomes empty after collection | **Right** | Box now contains no items. |
| table remains empty | **Right** | No item was placed on it. |
| door remains unchanged | **Right** | No action affected the door. |
| potato never existed | **Right** | No potato was ever present. |
| human is “inside” the box | **Uncertain** | The action only places the human at the same coordinates; whether the human is physically inside the box is not confirmed by the environment model. |

**Summary**

All key assumptions about the key, diamond, and the resulting empty box proved correct. The only uncertain point is the claim that the human is “inside” the box; the model only records the shared location. No potato-related assumption was contradicted.

**Assumptions made**  
- Moving to (0,0) does not affect any other objects.  
- box_11 at (0,0) indeed contains diamond_10.  
- shelf_13 at (0,2) holds chest_12, which is closed and locked.  
- No new objects (e.g., a potato) appear in the new location.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- The move to (0,0) left all other objects unchanged.  
- box_11 contains diamond_10.  
- chest_12 remains closed and locked.  
- No new objects appeared.

**Assumptions made**

* Moving to (0,2) does not alter any objects.  
* The shelf at (0,2) still holds chest_12 (closed & locked).  
* No new objects (e.g., a potato) appear at (0,2).  
* The human is simply at the same coordinates as the shelf; we do not know if the human is physically inside the chest.

**Assumptions that proved right**

* The move left all other objects unchanged.  
* Shelf_13 still contains chest_12, which remains closed & locked.  
* No new objects appeared.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

* None. All stated assumptions held true.

[reflector] **Performed Action:** “Place a potato on the table”

**Effect on the world:**  
- No change – the table remains empty and no potato appears.

**Current facts (unchanged):**  
- Human at chamber, holding key_7 and diamond_5.  
- box_11 at (0,0) contains diamond_10.  
- shelf_13 at (0,2) holds closed‑locked chest_12.  
- chest_12 remains closed & locked.  
- table at (0,4) empty.  
- door_8 at (4,4) open & unlocked.  
- potato absent.

**Assumptions made:**  
- A potato existed in the inventory or environment.  
- The table was available for placement.  
- The action would succeed.

**Assumptions that proved right:**  
- Table is empty.  
- Door_8 remains open & unlocked.  
- No new objects appear spontaneously.

**Assumptions that proved wrong:**  
- The existence of a potato (none exists).  
- The action would succeed (it cannot).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- `chest_12` was closed‑locked → now **unlocked** (still closed).  
- No other objects were moved or altered.  
- The human remains in the chamber, holding `key_7` and `diamond_5`.  
- `box_11` still contains `diamond_10`; `shelf_13` still holds `chest_12`.  
- The table at (0,4) stays empty; `door_8` at (0,1) remains open/unlocked.

**Current facts**  
| Object | State / Location |
|--------|------------------|
| `chest_12` | unlocked, closed |
| `shelf_13` | holds `chest_12` |
| `box_11` | contains `diamond_10` |
| Human | at (0,2) in the chamber, inventory: `key_7`, `diamond_5` |
| Table | empty |
| `door_8` | open & unlocked at (0,1) |

**Assumptions made about the new state**  
- Unlocking `chest_12` does not automatically open it.  
- The key used (`key_7`) is still in the human’s inventory.  
- No other objects (e.g., a potato) appear or change state.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- `chest_12` is now unlocked.  
- The human still holds `key_7` and `diamond_5`.  
- All other objects remain unchanged.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- None (the action behaved exactly as expected).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (open chest_12)**  
- `chest_12` changes from *unlocked‑closed* to **open** (contents still unknown).  
- No other objects move or change state.  
- Human stays at (0,2) in the chamber, inventory unchanged (`key_7`, `diamond_5`).  
- `box_11` still holds `diamond_10`; `shelf_13` still holds `chest_12`.  
- Table remains empty; `door_8` remains open/unlocked at (0,1).

**Facts**  
| Object | State / Location |
|--------|------------------|
| `chest_12` | open (contents unknown) |
| `shelf_13` | holds `chest_12` |
| `box_11` | contains `diamond_10` |
| Human | at (0,2) in chamber, inventory: `key_7`, `diamond_5` |
| Table | empty |
| `door_8` | open & unlocked at (0,1) |

**Assumptions made**  
- Chest was unlocked, so opening would succeed.  
- Unlocking left it closed; opening would not affect other objects.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Chest was unlocked → action succeeded.  
- No other objects changed.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- Chest remained closed after unlocking; it is now open.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – *collected potato_9 from chest_12*  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human | at (0, 2) in the chamber, inventory: `key_7`, `diamond_5`, **potato_9** |
| `chest_12` | open, **empty** (was open before, now still open) |

| `door_8` | open & unlocked at (0, 1) |
| No other potatoes or objects exist elsewhere |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

* `chest_12` was open and contained `potato_9`.  
* Collecting the potato would remove it from the chest and add it to the human’s inventory.  
* The chest remains open after the potato is removed.  
* No other objects or locations change.

**Assumptions that proved right**

* Chest was indeed open and held `potato_9`.  
* The collection succeeded, adding `potato_9` to the inventory.  
* Chest stays open and becomes empty.  
* All other objects remain unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

* None – all stated assumptions behaved as expected.

**Assumptions made**

- Moving to (0,0) does not alter any objects or their states.  
- The human’s inventory remains unchanged.  
- The human is simply at the same coordinates as `box_11`; no automatic “inside‑box” effect.  
- No new objects appear or disappear.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- The move left all objects unchanged.  
- Inventory (`key_7`, `diamond_5`, `potato_9`) stayed the same.  
- `box_11` still contains `diamond_10`.  
- `chest_12` remains open and empty.  
- Table stays empty; `door_8` remains open/unlocked at (0,1).

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- None (all stated assumptions behaved as expected).

[reflector] **Effect of the last action – “collected diamond_10 from box_11”**

| Fact | Value |

| **Human** | at (0,0) in the chamber, inventory: `key_7`, `diamond_5`, `potato_9`, **diamond_10** |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

- The action would succeed because the key (`key_7`) was still in inventory and the box was accessible.  
- Removing the diamond would leave `box_11` empty but otherwise unchanged.  
- No other objects or locations would be affected by the collection.  

**Assumptions that proved right**

- `box_11` became empty after the diamond was taken.  
- The human’s inventory now contains `diamond_10` (along with `key_7`, `diamond_5`, `potato_9`).  
- All other objects (`shelf_13`, `chest_12`, `table`, `door_8`) remained unchanged.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

| **box_11** | at (0,0), **contains potato_9** |

---

### Assumptions made about the new state
1. The box was empty and accessible, so the potato could be placed inside.  
2. Dropping the potato would remove it from the human’s inventory.  
3. No other objects or locations would change.  
4. The human remains at (0,0) with the same inventory.

### Which assumptions proved right / wrong
- **Right**:  
  - `box_11` now contains `potato_9`.  
  - The human’s inventory no longer includes `potato_9`.  
  - All other objects (`shelf_13`, `chest_12`, `table`, `door_8`) stayed unchanged.  
- **Wrong**: none.  

All expectations matched the observed state.
