Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last step**  
- Human is at position (3.5, 1.5).  
- Inventory now contains **cucumber_3**; the cucumber is no longer on the floor.  
- **table_4** is still at (3.5, 0.5) and empty.

- **chest_5** is still at (2.0, 2.0), closed and unlocked.  

**Assumptions made**  
1. *Moving does not automatically pick up an object.* – **Incorrect**: the action log shows the cucumber was collected in this step.  
2. *Inventory stays empty after a pure move.* – **Incorrect** for the same reason.  
3. *All other objects keep their positions and states.* – **Correct**; potato, table and chest were unchanged.  

So the only false assumptions were those about the effect of moving on the inventory; everything else held true.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move (3.5, 1.5) → (3.5, 0.5))**

- **Human position:** (3.5, 0.5) – standing directly on the table.  
- **Inventory:** still contains **cucumber_3** (the cucumber has **not** been placed on the table).  
- **Table table_4:** remains at (3.5, 0.5) and its *contents list* is still empty.  
- **Potato potato_6:** unchanged at (0.5, 1.5).  
- **Chest chest_5:** unchanged at (2.0, 2.0), still **closed** and **unlocked**.  

**Assumptions made about the new state**

| Assumption | How it was applied | Was it correct? |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1. *Moving does not automatically place held objects onto the surface you move to.* | The cucumber stays in inventory after the move. | **Correct** – the cucumber is still being carried. |
| 2. *Moving does not change the contents of any container (e.g., the table).* | Table’s contents remain empty. | **Correct** – nothing was added to the table. |
| 3. *Moving does not affect unrelated objects.* | Potato and chest keep their positions and states. | **Correct** – they are unchanged. |
| 4. *The human’s location updates exactly to the target coordinates.* | Human is now at (3.5, 0.5). | **Correct** – location matches the move command. |

**Summary**

The only effect of the executed action was the update of the human’s position. All inventory, object positions, and object states remain exactly as they were before the move, confirming the assumptions that moving is a pure relocation operation and does not implicitly drop or interact with objects.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. **Dropping an object places it on the surface you are standing on.** – **Correct.** The cucumber appears in the table’s contents.  
2. **Dropping removes the object from the inventory.** – **Correct.** Inventory is empty.  
3. **The human’s position does not change when dropping.** – **Correct.** Still at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. **No other objects or states are affected by a drop action.** – **Correct.** Potato and chest remain unchanged.  

All assumptions proved right; the drop behaved exactly as expected.

[reflector] **Facts after the last actions**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human position | (3.5, 0.5) – standing on **table_4** |
| Human inventory | empty |
| **cucumber_3** location | on top of **table_4** (table’s contents) |
| **table_4** contents | contains **cucumber_3** |
| **potato_6** location | (0.5, 1.5) – unchanged |
| **chest_5** location & state | (2.0, 2.0), **closed**, **unlocked** – unchanged |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. **Dropping an object places it on the surface you are standing on.** – *Correct*. The cucumber appears in the table’s contents.  
2. **Dropping removes the object from the inventory.** – *Correct*. Inventory is now empty.  
3. **The human’s position does not change when dropping.** – *Correct*. Still at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. **No other objects or states are affected by a drop action.** – *Correct*. Potato and chest remain unchanged.  

All assumptions proved right; the actions behaved exactly as expected.

[observer] I see that I am standing at (3.5, 0.5) on the table table_4.  
My inventory is empty.  
The cucumber cucumber_3 is now on top of the table (it appears in the table’s contents).  
All other objects remain unchanged: the potato is at (0.5, 1.5) and the chest is at (2.0, 2.0), closed and unlocked.

| 3 | The human’s position does not change when dropping. | **Correct** – still at (3.5, 0.5). |
| 4 | Moving does not affect other objects or their states. | **Correct** – potato and chest unchanged. |
| 5 | Moving does **not** automatically pick up objects you step onto. | **Incorrect** – the initial move onto the cucumber automatically added it to the inventory. |

All other assumptions held true; only the one about automatic pickup during movement was false.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the actions**

- Human position: **(3.5, 0.5)** – standing on **table_4**.  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **cucumber_3**: on top of **table_4** (the table’s contents now include the cucumber).  
- **table_4**: at (3.5, 0.5) and holds the cucumber.  
- **potato_6:** unchanged at (0.5, 1.5).  
- **chest_5:** unchanged at (2.0, 2.0), **closed**, **unlocked**.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. Dropping an object places it on the surface you are standing on. – **Correct**.  
2. Dropping removes the object from the inventory. – **Correct**.  
3. The human’s position does not change when dropping. – **Correct**.  
4. No other objects or states are affected by a drop action. – **Correct**.  

**Incorrect assumption that was previously made**

- *Moving automatically picks up objects you step onto.* – **Wrong** (the move only relocated the human; the cucumber was later taken explicitly).
