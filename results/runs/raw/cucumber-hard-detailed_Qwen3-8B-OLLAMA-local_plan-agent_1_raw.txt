[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Moved to (3.5,1.5), where the cucumber is located.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Cucumber is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5,0.5) and empty.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber is pickable (confirmed).  
- No obstacles block movement (confirmed).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber is accessible and can be picked up.  
- Table is ready to receive the cucumber.  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- Next steps (pickup, movement to table, placement) will succeed.

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
- Cucumber is now in the agent's inventory (collected).  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5) with cucumber_3.  
- Table remains at (3.5,0.5) and empty.  

**Assumptions about new state:**  
- Agent can move to table (3.5,0.5) and place cucumber there.  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber was successfully picked up.  
- Table is still empty and ready to receive the cucumber.  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- Movement to table and placement will succeed.  

**Errors/Corrections:**  
None. All assumptions align with the environment's confirmed state.
