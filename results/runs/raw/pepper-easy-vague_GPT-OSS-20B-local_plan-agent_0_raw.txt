[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.0).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or placed.  

**Facts in the new state**

| Object | Position | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.0) | on the floor |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) | on the floor (overlaps the human) |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Pepper 4 | (3.0, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can occupy the same coordinates as a pepper without automatically picking it up.  
2. The pepper remains at its original location unless explicitly moved.  
3. The table remains empty until an object is placed on it.  
4. The goal “place all peppers on the table” is not yet satisfied.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- Assumptions 1, 2, 3, and 4 about the state after the move all held true.  
- The implicit assumption that the goal was achieved by this single move proved false.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human picked up Pepper 5 while standing at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Pepper 5 is now in the human’s inventory and no longer on the floor.  
- The human’s position and the positions of Pepper 3 and Pepper 4 are unchanged.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) remains empty.

**Updated facts**

| Object | Position | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.0) | on the floor |
| Pepper 5 | **in inventory** | carried |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Pepper 4 | (3.0, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can pick up an object that occupies the same coordinates.  
2. Picking up an object removes it from the floor and places it in the inventory.  
3. The inventory can hold at least one pepper.  
4. The table remains empty until an object is explicitly placed on it.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- **Held**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 all hold in the new state.  
- **Failed**: None – the action behaved exactly as assumed.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

1. **Pick up Pepper 3** – Pepper 3 is removed from the floor and placed in the human’s inventory.  
2. **Move to the table (3.5, 0.5)** – Human’s position changes to the table’s coordinates.  
3. **Drop Pepper 3** – Pepper 3 is placed on the table.  
4. **Move to Pepper 4 (3.0, 1.5)** – Human’s position changes to Pepper 4’s coordinates.  
5. **Pick up Pepper 4** – Pepper 4 is removed from the floor and placed in the inventory.  
6. **Move to the table (3.5, 0.5)** – Human’s position changes to the table again.  
7. **Drop Pepper 4** – Pepper 4 is placed on the table.

**Updated facts**

| Object   | Position | Status          |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table   |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table   |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table   |
| Pepper 4 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table   |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | contains 3 peppers |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can pick up an object that occupies the same coordinates.  
2. The human can drop an object onto a table while standing on it.  
3. The inventory can hold one pepper at a time (the human drops the first before picking up the second).  
4. Moving onto the table does not alter the table’s contents.  
5. The table can hold multiple objects.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- **Held**: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 all held true in the new state.  
- **Failed**: None – all actions behaved as expected.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human picked up Pepper 3 while standing at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 3 is now in the human’s inventory and no longer on the floor.  
- The human’s position and the positions of Pepper 5 and Pepper 4 are unchanged.

| Pepper 4 | (3.0, 1.5) | on the floor   |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | contains Pepper 5 |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can pick up an object that occupies the same coordinates.  
2. Picking up an object removes it from the floor and places it in the inventory.  
3. The inventory can hold at least one pepper.  
4. The table remains unchanged unless an object is explicitly placed on it.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Pepper 3 was removed from the human’s inventory and placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The human remains standing on the floor at (3.5, 1.5).  
- No other objects moved.

**Updated facts**

| Object   | Position | Status                |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor          |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table          |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table          |
| Pepper 4 | (3.0, 1.5) | on the floor          |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | contains 2 peppers    |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can drop an object onto a table even when not standing on it.  
2. Dropping removes the object from the inventory and places it on the table.  
3. The table can hold multiple objects.  
4. The human’s position is unchanged by dropping.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

All four assumptions held true; the state matches the expected outcome.

All four assumptions proved correct.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- Pepper 3 was removed from the human’s inventory and placed on the table at location 6.  
- The human remains at the same coordinates (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 5 stays on the table; Pepper 4 remains in the inventory.  

**Current facts**  

| Object   | Position   | Status                |
|----------|------------|-----------------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor          |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table          |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table          |
| Pepper 4 | in inventory | carried             |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | contains 2 peppers    |

**Assumptions made**  

1. Dropping an item removes it from the inventory.  
2. The dropped item is placed on the target table.  
3. The table can hold multiple items.  
4. The human’s position is unchanged by the drop.  

**Assumptions that held**  
All four assumptions proved correct.
