[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

- Human is now at (1, 4).  
- Carrot remains in the human’s inventory.  
- Table at (1, 4) is still empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. Moving to the table’s coordinates would automatically place the carrot on the table.  
2. The carrot would be removed from the inventory and appear on the table.

**Outcome of the assumptions**

- Assumption 1 was **incorrect**: the move action alone does not place the carrot.  
- Assumption 2 was **incorrect**: the carrot is still in the inventory and the table remains empty.

- Human is still at (1, 4).  
- Carrot is now on the table at (1, 4).

**Assumptions made**

1. Dropping the carrot removes it from the inventory and places it on the table.

No other assumptions were involved.

[reflector] **Effect of the actions**

- The human moved to the table’s coordinates (1, 4).  
- The carrot was dropped, removing it from the inventory and placing it on the table.  
- The human’s location did not change during the drop.

**Resulting facts**

- Human is at (1, 4).  
- Carrot is on the table at (1, 4).  
- Table at (1, 4) is no longer empty.  
- Human’s inventory is empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. Dropping the carrot removes it from the inventory and places it on the table.  
2. The human’s location remains unchanged when dropping an item.  
3. Moving to the table’s coordinates alone would automatically place the carrot on the table.  

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Assumption 1: The carrot disappeared from inventory and appeared on the table.  
- Assumption 2: The human stayed at (1, 4).

**Assumption that proved wrong**

- Assumption 3: Moving alone does not place the carrot; dropping is required.
