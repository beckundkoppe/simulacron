[reflector] **Facts:**

**Assumptions:**  
- The agent can collect pepper_5 by moving to (3.5,1).  
- The table is accessible and requires no interaction (e.g., opening).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Collecting pepper_5 was successful.  

**Incorrect Assumptions:**  
- The agent did not yet place pepper_5 on the table (requires additional movement to the table's location).  

**Next Steps:** Move to the table (3.5,0.5) and drop pepper_5 there. Repeat for peppers_3 and_4.

[ACTION EXECUTED] collected pepper_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **pepper_4** is now collected by the agent.  
- Agent is at (3.0,1.5) (pepper_4's position).  

**Facts:**  
- Table contains **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- **pepper_4** is now collected and in the agent's inventory.  
- Agent is at (3.0,1.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
- Agent can move to the table (3.5,0.5) to drop **pepper_4**.  
- Table remains accessible for dropping items.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Collection of **pepper_4** succeeded.  

**Incorrect Assumptions:**  
- Belief that **pepper_4** was already on the table (proven wrong).  

**Next Steps:** Move to the table (3.5,0.5) and drop **pepper_4** to complete the task.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**  
- **pepper_4** is now in the agent's inventory (collected).  
- The **table** already contains **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- Agent is at (3.0,1.5) (pepper_4's original position) with **pepper_4** collected.  

**Relevant Facts for Goal:**  
- Only **pepper_4** remains unplaced.  
- Agent must move to the table (3.5,0.5) to drop **pepper_4**.  

**Next Action:** Move to the table (3.5,0.5) and drop **pepper_4** to complete the task.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
