Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan is not yet sufficiently decomposed. “Place a potato on the table” is a high‑level goal that still requires several concrete steps: locate a potato, move to it, pick it up, navigate to the table, and put the potato down on the table. These sub‑actions need to be enumerated before execution can begin.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the move action**

- **Fact added:** The human’s current location is now (2, 2) instead of the starting point (0, 0).
- **Fact unchanged:** The table remains at (0, 3), the key at (3, 1), and the door at (4, 4). No potato has been observed yet.
- **Assumption made:** That moving toward the center of the room would bring the human closer to any unseen potato.  
  - **Proved right?** Not yet—no potato was encountered during the move, so the assumption that a potato is nearby remains unverified.
- **Assumption validated:** The movement itself succeeded; the agent can navigate to arbitrary coordinates without obstruction.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Plan tree:
- [6] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [7] Find a potato
  - [8] Pick up the potato
  - [9] Carry the potato to the table
  - [10] Place the potato on the table
Available leaf tasks:
[7] Find a potato
[8] Pick up the potato
[9] Carry the potato to the table
[10] Place the potato on the table
Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] 7 – Find a potato.  
We have no potato in the current perception, so the first necessary step is to locate one before we can pick it up, carry it, or place it. This task must be completed before any of the later subtasks can be performed.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the failed move**

- Human’s location is still at the start position (0, 0).  
- Table remains at (0, 3) and is empty.  
- Key remains at (3, 1).  
- Door remains at (4, 4), closed but unlocked.  
- No potato is visible in the current view.

**Assumptions made**

- *Assumption:* Moving toward the centre of the room (to (2, 2)) would bring the human closer to any unseen potato.  
  - **Result:** Wrong – the move was impossible (out of bounds), so the human did not get closer and still sees no potato.  
- *Assumption:* The agent can navigate to any coordinate inside the room without obstruction.  
  - **Result:** Wrong – the room’s walls prevented moving to (2, 2).  

No new assumptions were validated; the attempted action only confirmed that the attempted target is outside the allowed area.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node is to find a potato, but after the attempted move no potato was observed and the human remains at the start position. Therefore the goal of locating a potato has not been achieved, so the node is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The current plan (“find a potato”) has not yet succeeded—no potato was observed after the attempted move, and the human is still at the start position. However, the environment still contains unknown areas (e.g., beyond the closed door or other locations not yet visited). Continuing to explore those areas can still reveal a potato, after which it can be taken and placed on the table. Therefore the plan remains viable.

**Decision:** Yes, the plan still seems promising.

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *Moving to (2, 2) would bring the human closer to any unseen potato.* – **Wrong** (the move was not possible; the potato was not found).  
2. *The agent can navigate to any coordinate inside the room without obstruction.* – **Wrong** (the room’s boundaries prevented the move).  

**Validated assumptions**

- None of the pre‑move assumptions were validated; both were disproved by the failed attempt.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is already broken down into concrete, executable steps:

1. **Find a potato** – locate a potato in the environment.  
2. **Take the potato** – pick it up once it’s found.  
3. **Move to the table** – navigate to the table’s position.  
4. **Place the potato on the table** – drop it onto the table surface.

Each sub‑goal is atomic and can be directly acted upon, so the tree is sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to door_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the move**  
- Human is now at **(4.0, 4.0)**, i.e., standing at **door_6**.  
- **table_5** remains at **(0.0, 3.0)** and its surface is still empty.  
- **key_4** remains at **(3.0, 1.0)**.  
- **door_6** is still **closed** and **unlocked**.  
- No potato is visible in the current view.

**Assumptions made before moving**  
1. *I can walk to the door’s location.* – **proved right** (the move succeeded).  
2. *Being at the door might give me a view of a hidden potato.* – **proved wrong** (the view still shows no potato).

No other assumptions were introduced. The environment state is unchanged except for the human’s new position at the door.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The last action moved the human to the door but no potato was observed and the table remains empty, so the goal of finding a potato has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: open door_6
go through door_6
take potato
move to table_5
drop potato

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action “open door_6”**

- Human is at (4.0, 4.0), standing on the doorway.  
- **door_6** is now **open** (was closed, unlocked).  
- **table_5** remains at (0.0, 3.0) with an empty surface.  
- **key_4** is still at (3.0, 1.0).  
- Inventory is empty.  
- No potato is visible anywhere in the current view.

**Assumptions made before opening the door**

1. *The door can be opened because it is unlocked.* – **proved right** (the door opened successfully).  
2. *Opening the door might expose a hidden potato.* – **proved wrong** (the view after opening still shows no potato).  

No other assumptions were introduced.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action “go through door_6”**

- **Location:** I am now in the adjacent chamber (the space on the far side of door_6).  
- **Door state:** door_6 remains **open** and **unlocked**.  
- **Inventory:** still empty – I have not picked up anything.  
- **Visible objects:** the chamber currently shows **no potato** (and no other objects were reported).  
- **Table, key, and door** are still where they were in the “main” room; they are not in my current view.

**Assumptions made before moving through the door**

1. *The door can be traversed because it is open.* – **proved right** (the move succeeded).  
2. *The chamber might contain a potato (or other useful items).* – **proved wrong so far** (the chamber is empty of potatoes).  

**New assumptions (post‑move)**  

- *If a potato exists anywhere in the environment, it must be in a different room or still unseen in the current chamber.* – still untested.  
- *The door will stay open while I am on the other side.* – reasonable and uncontradicted so far.  

No other changes to the world state have occurred. The next step is to keep searching for a potato (e.g., look around, move to other locations, or open other doors).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan node **“Find a potato”** is **not** completed.  
I have moved into the adjacent chamber, opened the door, and looked around, but the chamber (and all previously observed rooms) contain no potato. Since no potato has been located yet, the goal of finding one is still unmet.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node 'Find a potato' is not completed because after exploring the main room, opening the door, and entering the adjacent chamber, no potato has been observed anywhere. The goal of locating a potato remains unmet.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
We have already inspected the main room and the adjacent chamber and still see no potato. The goal “place a potato on the table” therefore requires first finding a potato elsewhere (perhaps in another room or hidden behind an object). Since the environment still contains unexplored space, continuing to search is the only way to achieve the goal.

**Conclusion:** The plan “Find a potato” is still promising; we should keep exploring (e.g., return through the door, move to new coordinates, look for other doors/rooms) until a potato is discovered, then pick it up and place it on the table.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the move (0.0, 1.0) → (0.0, 0.0)**  

- Human location: **(0.0, 0.0)** in the “chamber”.  
- **shelf_10** remains at (0.0, 0.0) holding **chest_9**, which still contains **potato_7**.  
- **box_11** stays at (0.0, 2.0) and still contains **diamond_8**.  
- **door_6** is still at (0.0, 1.0), open and unlocked.  
- Inventory: **empty** (nothing has been picked up).  

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *The square (0, 0) is reachable (no obstacle).* → **proved right** – the move succeeded.  
2. *Moving to (0, 0) will put me nearer to the potato (which is in the chest on the shelf at that spot).* → **proved right** – I am now standing exactly where the chest containing the potato is located.  

No other new assumptions were introduced, and all prior assumptions hold true in the updated state.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The current reflection shows that the potato (`potato_7`) has been located inside `chest_9` on `shelf_10` in the chamber. Since the plan node “Find a potato” is satisfied as soon as the potato is discovered, that sub‑goal is complete. The next step will be to obtain the potato and place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The current reflection shows that the potato (`potato_7`) has been located inside `chest_9` on `shelf_10` in the chamber. Since the plan node “Find a potato” is satisfied as soon as the potato is discovered, that sub‑goal is complete. The next step will be to obtain the potato and place it on the table.

- **shelf 10** is at (0.0, 0.0) and holds **chest 9**.  
- **chest 9** is still closed and contains **potato 7** (the potato is *inside* the chest, not on the floor).  
- **box 11** is at (0.0, 2.0) with **diamond 8** inside.  
- **door 6** is at (0.0, 1.0), open and unlocked.  
- My inventory is empty.  

**Assumptions made before the “take potato 7” action**

1. *The potato is directly graspable because it is visible on the shelf.* – **proved wrong**: the potato is inside a closed chest, so the “take” operator cannot act on it.  
2. *“take” works on any object that is inside another container.* – **proved wrong**: the correct sequence is to open the chest first, then take the potato.

**Validated assumptions**

- The location of the chest (and thus the potato) is correctly identified – I am standing at the same coordinates as the chest.  
- The chest is currently closed, so the potato cannot be taken directly.

**Next minimal actions to achieve the goal**

1. `open chest_9` (or `unlock` if needed, but it appears unlocked).  
2. `take potato_7` (now that it is exposed).  

No other world state changes occurred.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The chest is still closed and the potato remains inside it, so the “take the potato” action has not been performed yet. The required steps (opening the chest and then taking the potato) are still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No. The chest is still closed and the potato remains inside it, so the “take the potato” action has not been performed yet. The required steps (opening the chest and then taking the potato) are still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The chest is still closed and the potato remains inside it, so the 'take potato' action has not been performed yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: open chest_9
take potato_7
move (0.0, 1.0)
go through door_6
move (0.0, 3.0)
drop potato_7
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observation**

- I am in the room **“chamber”** at position (0.0, 0.0).  
- On the shelf `shelf_10` at this location sits a **closed chest** `chest_9`.  
- Inside `chest_9` is a **potato** `potato_7`.  
- The box `box_11` at (0.0, 2.0) holds a diamond `diamond_8`.  
- The door `door_6` at (0.0, 1.0) is open and unlocked.  
- My inventory is empty.  

The potato is not directly graspable because it is inside the closed chest. The next minimal step is to open the chest.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the failed `take potato_7`:**  
- Human is still at (0.0, 0.0) in the *chamber*.  
- `shelf_10` holds a **closed** `chest_9`.  
- `chest_9` still contains `potato_7`; the potato has **not** been removed.  
- `box_11` (with `diamond_8`) and `door_6` remain unchanged.  
- Inventory is still empty.  

**Assumptions made before the action:**  
1. *The potato can be taken directly because it is “visible” on the shelf.* – **Wrong**; the potato is inside a closed chest, so the “take” operator does not apply.  
2. *“take” works on any visible object regardless of containment.* – **Wrong**; the correct procedure is to open the container first.  

**Validated assumptions:**  
- The location of the chest (and thus the potato) is correctly known – we are standing exactly where the chest is.  
- The chest is closed, which prevents direct extraction of its contents.  

**Effect of the action:** No state change occurred; the failed “take” confirmed that the potato is not directly graspable while the chest remains closed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The last action “take potato_7” failed because the chest is still closed, so the potato remains inside it. The goal of taking the potato has not been achieved yet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No. The last action “take potato_7” failed because the chest is still closed, so the potato remains inside it. The goal of taking the potato has not been achieved yet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The last action 'take potato_7' failed because the chest containing the potato is still closed, so the potato was not taken. Therefore the plan node 'Take the potato' is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: open chest_9
take potato_7
move 0 1
go through door_6
move 0 3
drop potato_7
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[observer] I see a **shelf** at (0.0, 0.0) holding a **closed chest** `chest_9`. Inside that chest is a **potato** `potato_7`.  
The **box** `box_11` at (0.0, 2.0) contains a diamond, and the **door** `door_6` at (0.0, 1.0) is open and unlocked.  
No other objects (including the table) are visible from here.  

**Relevant fact for the current plan:** the potato is inside a closed chest, so the chest must be opened before the potato can be taken.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (“take potato_7”)**

- The interaction failed – no state changed.  
- The chest `chest_9` remains **closed**.  
- The potato `potato_7` is still **inside** the chest.  
- My inventory is still **empty**.  
- My position is unchanged at **(0.0, 0.0)** in the *chamber*.

**Current facts**

1. I am in the chamber at (0.0, 0.0).  
2. `shelf_10` at (0.0, 0.0) holds a **closed** `chest_9`.  
3. `chest_9` contains `potato_7`.  
4. `box_11` at (0.0, 2.0) contains `diamond_8`.  
5. `door_6` at (0.0, 1.0) is open and unlocked.  
6. Inventory: empty.

**Assumptions made before the failed “take”**

- *Assumption 1:* “Take potato_7” would succeed because the potato is visible. **Result:** **Wrong** – the potato is hidden inside a closed container, so the “take” operator cannot act on it.  
- *Assumption 2:* The “take” operator works on any visible object regardless of containment. **Result:** **Wrong** – containers must be opened first.

**Validated assumptions**

- The chest’s location and its contents are correctly identified (I am standing at the chest).  
- The chest is indeed closed, which prevents direct extraction of its contents.

**Next minimal step**: `open chest_9` (then `take potato_7`).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan “Take the potato” has not been achieved yet. The last attempt to `take potato_7` failed since the chest containing it is still closed, so the potato is still not in the inventory. Therefore the focused plan node is not completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The plan “Take the potato” has not been achieved yet. The last attempt to `take potato_7` failed since the chest containing it is still closed, so the potato is still not in the inventory. Therefore the focused plan node is not completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node 'Take the potato' is not completed because the chest containing the potato is still closed, and the last attempt to take the potato failed. The potato is still not in the inventory.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan to take the potato is still viable – the only obstacle is the closed chest. Opening the chest will expose the potato, after which a single `take` action will succeed. Since the chest can be opened (it is unlocked) and we are already standing at its location, the next minimal step is to open the chest, then take the potato.  

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node 'Take the potato' is not completed because the chest containing the potato is still closed, and the last attempt to take the potato failed. The potato is still not in the inventory.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The plan to take the potato is still viable – the only obstacle is the closed chest. Opening the chest will expose the potato, after which a single `take` action will succeed. Since the chest can be opened (it is unlocked) and we are already standing at its location, the next minimal step is to open the chest, then take the potato.  

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the failed `take potato_7`**

- I am still at position (0.0, 0.0) in the *chamber*.
- `shelf_10` is at (0.0, 0.0) holding a **closed** `chest_9`.
- `chest_9` **contains** `potato_7`; the potato is inside the chest, not on the floor.
- `box_11` at (0.0, 2.0) still contains `diamond_8`.
- `door_6` at (0.0, 1.0) remains **open** and **unlocked**.
- My inventory is still empty.

**Assumptions made before the failed action**

1. *The potato is directly graspable because it is visible on the shelf.*  
   - **Result:** **Wrong** – the potato is hidden inside a closed chest, so `take` cannot act on it.

2. *The `take` operator works on any visible object regardless of containment.*  
   - **Result:** **Wrong** – containers must be opened before their contents can be taken.

**Validated assumptions**

- The chest’s location and its contents are correctly known (I am standing exactly where the chest is).  
- The chest is indeed closed, which blocks direct extraction of the potato.

**Next minimal step** (to achieve the goal “place a potato on the table”):  
- `open chest_9` → then `take potato_7` → later carry it to the table and `place potato_7 on table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan node “Take the potato” is **not** completed.  
The last reflected action was a failed `take potato_7` because the potato is still inside a closed chest. The chest must be opened first before the potato can be taken. Therefore the goal of taking the potato has not been achieved yet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The plan node “Take the potato” is **not** completed.  
The last reflected action was a failed `take potato_7` because the potato is still inside a closed chest. The chest must be opened first before the potato can be taken. Therefore the goal of taking the potato has not been achieved yet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The last action was a failed `take potato_7` because the potato is inside a closed chest. Since the potato was not successfully taken, the plan node 'Take the potato' is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  
You have already located the only potato in the environment (inside `chest_9` on `shelf_10`). The only obstacle is the closed chest, which can be opened with a single `open chest_9` action. Once the chest is open, a `take potato_7` will succeed, after which you can carry the potato back through `door_6` to the main room and `place potato_7 on table_5`. The remaining steps are straightforward, so continuing with the “open → take → place” sequence remains a viable path to the goal.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The last action was a failed `take potato_7` because the potato is inside a closed chest. Since the potato was not successfully taken, the plan node 'Take the potato' is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  
You have already located the only potato in the environment (inside `chest_9` on `shelf_10`). The only obstacle is the closed chest, which can be opened with a single `open chest_9` action. Once the chest is open, a `take potato_7` will succeed, after which you can carry the potato back through `door_6` to the main room and `place potato_7 on table_5`. The remaining steps are straightforward, so continuing with the “open → take → place” sequence remains a viable path to the goal.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – `take potato_7` (failed)**  

- **No state changed.**  

**Current facts**  
- I am at (0.0, 0.0) in the *chamber*.  
- `shelf_10` holds a **closed** `chest_9` at the same coordinates.  
- `chest_9` **contains** `potato_7` (the potato is inside, not on the floor).  
- `box_11` at (0.0, 2.0) still contains `diamond_8`.  
- `door_6` at (0.0, 1.0) remains open and unlocked.  
- My inventory is empty.

**Assumptions made before the failed “take”**  
1. *The potato is directly graspable because it is visible on the shelf.* – **Wrong** (it is hidden inside a closed chest).  
2. *The `take` operator works on any visible object regardless of containment.* – **Wrong** (containers must be opened first).

**Validated assumptions**  
- The chest’s position and its contents are correctly known – I am standing exactly where the chest is.  
- The chest is closed, which blocks direct extraction of its contents.

**New (still untested) assumptions**  
- The chest can be opened (`open chest_9`).  
- Once opened, the potato will become take‑able.

**Next minimal step**: `open chest_9` → then `take potato_7`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action attempted was `take potato_7`, but it failed because the potato is inside a closed chest. The chest `chest_9` remains closed, the potato is still contained within it, and the inventory is empty. Therefore the objective “take the potato” has not been achieved.

**Answer:** No – the “take the potato” plan node is still incomplete.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The last action attempted was `take potato_7`, but it failed because the potato is inside a closed chest. The chest `chest_9` remains closed, the potato is still contained within it, and the inventory is empty. Therefore the objective “take the potato” has not been achieved.

**Answer:** No – the “take the potato” plan node is still incomplete.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The last action 'take potato_7' failed because the potato is inside a closed chest. The chest remains closed, the potato is still not in inventory, and thus the goal of taking the potato has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The current plan – *take potato_7* – cannot succeed while the chest that hides the potato remains closed. The last execution showed that the “take” operator fails when the target is inside a closed container, and the state after the action is unchanged: the chest is still closed and the potato is still inside it, so the goal of possessing the potato is not met.

**Therefore the plan is not promising in its present form.**  
The minimal corrective step is to open the chest first, after which the potato will become reachable. A viable continuation is:

1. `open chest_9` → the chest becomes open.  
2. `take potato_7` → the potato is now take‑able and will be added to your inventory.

Only after those two steps can you proceed toward the higher‑level goal “place the potato on the table”. So the plan should be revised to include `open chest_9` before attempting to take the potato.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** No.

**Reasoning:**  
The current plan tree contains only the high‑level goal *“Place a potato on the table.”* To execute the goal we still need several concrete sub‑tasks (opening the chest, taking the potato, moving back to the main room, navigating to the table, and finally placing the potato). Since these lower‑level steps have not been broken out, the plan is not yet sufficiently decomposed for execution. We should first expand the goal into its necessary sub‑goals before issuing any actions.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **No – the plan still needs a bit of decomposition before it can be executed.**

**Why the tree isn’t ready**

| Step in the current tree | Why it isn’t a primitive action yet |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **go to door_6**         | The agent must move from its current position (0, 0) to the door’s coordinates (0, 1). The system only understands explicit navigation actions such as `go 0 1` (or a sequence of `move` steps), not a vague “go to”. |
| **go to table_5**        | The table lives in a different room (main). Getting there requires: <br>1. `go through door_6` (already listed) <br>2. Navigating inside *main* from the door location (4, 4) to the table’s location (0, 3). This again must be expressed as concrete move commands (e.g., `go 3 4`, `go 2 4`, …). |
| **go through door_6**   | This is a valid primitive, but it assumes the agent is already standing on the door. The preceding “go to door_6” must be resolved first. |
| **open chest_9** & **take potato_7** | These are already primitive actions, so they are fine. |

**What’s missing**

* Decompose the two “go to …” steps into concrete navigation actions (or a single `go` command with target coordinates if the engine accepts that).  
* After `go through door_6`, add the needed navigation steps inside the *main* room to reach `(0, 3)` (the table’s location).  

Once those movement actions are broken down, the plan will be fully executable:

```
open chest_9
take potato_7
go 0 1          ← reach the door
go through door_6
go 3 4
go 2 4
go 1 4
go 0 4
go 0 3          ← arrive at table_5
place potato_7 on table_5
```

Only after this finer‑grained decomposition can the agent start executing the plan.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer: Yes – the plan is now fully decomposed enough to start executing.**

**Reasoning**

1. **Pre‑conditions are satisfied**  
   * The chest (`chest_9`) is known to be closed but unlocked, so `open chest_9` is a valid primitive action.  
   * The potato (`potato_7`) is inside that chest, so after the chest is opened the primitive `take potato_7` will succeed.  
   * The door (`door_6`) is already open, so `go to door_6` and `go through door_6` are executable without extra steps.

2. **Navigation steps are concrete**  
   * From the current position `(0, 0)` in the chamber, moving to the door at `(0, 1)` and then traversing it puts the agent at `(4, 4)` in the main room.  
   * From there, moving to the table at `(0, 3)` is a simple walk‑to action; no additional obstacles or containers block the path.

3. **Goal‑direct actions are ready**  
   * Once the potato is in the inventory, `place potato_7 on table_5` can be executed directly because the table’s surface is empty.

All necessary primitives are identified and no further decomposition (e.g., opening a lock, moving an intermediate obstacle) is required. The plan can therefore be started as is.

**Assumptions made before the actions**

| Assumption | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ *The chest can be opened (it is not locked).* | **Proved right** – `open chest_9` succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ *Opening the chest will make the potato visible and thus take‑able.* | **Proved right** – after opening, the potato could be collected. |
| 3️⃣ *The `take`/`collect` operator will place the potato into my inventory.* | **Proved right** – inventory now contains `potato_7`. |
| 4️⃣ *Opening the chest does not affect other objects (door, box, etc.).* | **Proved right** – all other objects remain unchanged. |

No assumptions were contradicted. The world state now includes the potato in my possession and an open, empty chest.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The reflection shows that `open chest_9` was successfully executed – the chest is now open. Therefore the intended action of the plan node has already been performed, so the node is complete. **Yes, the focused plan node is completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The reflection shows that `open chest_9` was successfully executed – the chest is now open. Therefore the intended action of the plan node has already been performed, so the node is complete. **Yes, the focused plan node is completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[observer] **Observation**

- I am still in the **chamber** at position (0.0, 0.0).  
- My inventory now contains **potato 7**.  
- **chest 9** (on **shelf 10** at (0.0, 0.0)) is **open** and **empty**.  
- **box 11** remains at (0.0, 2.0) and still contains **diamond 8**.  
- **door 6** stays at (0.0, 1.0), **open** and **unlocked**.  

*New discovery*: the chest is open and no longer holds the potato; the potato is now in my inventory.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to door_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action “move (0.0, 0.0) → door_6”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Location** | Human is now at **(0.0, 1.0)** – the cell occupied by **door_6** in the *chamber*. |
| **Room** | Still the **chamber** (size 1 × 3). |
| **Inventory** | Contains **potato_7** (the potato is being carried). |
| **door_6** | Position **(0.0, 1.0)**, **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **chest_9** | Still **open** and **empty** (the potato has been removed). |
| **shelf_10** | Holds the (now‑open) **chest_9** at (0.0, 0.0). |
| **box_11** | At (0.0, 2.0) containing **diamond_8** (unchanged). |
| **table_5** | Remains in the *main* room at (0.0, 3.0) with an empty surface. |
| **key_4** | Still at (3.0, 1.0) in the *main* room. |
| **Other objects** | No other objects are visible from the new position. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** moving to the door

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | *The square (0.0, 1.0) occupied by the door is traversable (no obstacle).* | **Proved right** – the move succeeded and I now stand on the door cell. |
| 2️⃣ | *Carrying the potato will not cause it to be dropped automatically.* | **Proved right** – the potato remains in the inventory after the move. |
| 3️⃣ | *The door will stay open while I step onto its cell.* | **Proved right** – `door_6` is still open and unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | *Moving does not affect the state of other objects (chest, box, etc.).* | **Proved right** – chest stays open/empty, box and its diamond are unchanged. |

---

### New (still untested) assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | *From the door cell I can re‑enter the “main” room (through the same doorway) without any further restriction.* |
| A2️⃣ | *Once in the main room I will be able to reach `table_5` and place the carried potato on it.* |
| A3️⃣ | *No hidden traps or locks will appear on the door while I stand on it.* |

These will be verified when the next actions (e.g., “go through door_6”, “go to table_5”, “place potato_7 on table_5”) are attempted.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The potato is already in your inventory (it was taken after opening the chest). Since the state shows `potato_7` in your inventory, the “take potato_7” step has been fulfilled.  
**Yes, the focused plan node is completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The potato is already in your inventory (it was taken after opening the chest). Since the state shows `potato_7` in your inventory, the “take potato_7” step has been fulfilled.  
**Yes, the focused plan node is completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into main
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “go through door_6 into main”**

| Fact | Value (after the action) |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Location** | (0.0 , 1.0) in the **main** room (the cell that the door occupies). |
| **Room** | *main* (size 5 × 5). |
| **Inventory** | still contains **potato 7**. |
| **door_6** | at (0.0 , 1.0), **open** and **unlocked** (remains unchanged). |
| **shelf_10 / chest_9** | still at (0.0 , 0.0) in the *chamber*; chest is **open** and **empty**. |
| **box_11** | at (0.0 , 2.0) in the *chamber*, still contains **diamond 8**. |
| **table_5** | at (0.0 , 3.0) in the *main* room, surface is empty. |
| **key_4** | still at (3.0 , 1.0) in the *main* room. |
| **Other objects** | unchanged. |

---

### Assumptions made *before* the “go through door_6” action  

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | The square (0.0 , 1.0) occupied by the door is traversable (no obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato will not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – potato is still in inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door will stay open while I step onto/through its cell. | **Proved right** – door remains open and unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not alter the state of any other objects (chest, box, etc.). | **Proved right** – chest stays open/empty, box unchanged. |
| 5️⃣ (implicit) | The doorway leads to the *main* room at the same coordinates, and that cell in the main room is free. | **Proved right** – I am now in the main room at (0.0 , 1.0). |

---

### New (still untested) assumptions about the **current** state  

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (0.0 , 1.0) in the main room I can walk to the table at (0.0 , 3.0) without blockage. |
| A2️⃣ | The table’s surface will accept the potato when I issue `place potato_7 on table_5`. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden traps or locks will appear on the door while I stand on its cell. |
| A4️⃣ | The chest remains open and empty even after I leave the chamber. |

*These will be verified by the next navigation and placement actions.*

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflected action shows you have already moved onto the door’s cell (0.0, 1.0) in the **chamber** and then stepped through it into the **main** room. Reaching the door’s location was the goal of the “go to door_6” node, so that node is finished.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The last reflected action shows you have already moved onto the door’s cell (0.0, 1.0) in the **chamber** and then stepped through it into the **main** room. Reaching the door’s location was the goal of the “go to door_6” node, so that node is finished.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **State after “go through door_6 into chamber”**

| Fact | Value (now) |
|------|--------------|
| **Location** | Human is in the **chamber** on the cell occupied by `door_6` (the door’s chamber‑side coordinate, (0.0, 1.0)). |
| **Room** | *chamber* (size 1 × 3). |
| **Inventory** | Still contains **potato 7**. |
| **door_6** | At (0.0, 1.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **shelf_10** | At (0.0, 0.0) holding an **open, empty** `chest_9`. |
| **chest_9** | **Open**, **empty** (the potato has been removed). |
| **box_11** | At (0.0, 2.0) in the chamber, still contains **diamond 8**. |
| **table_5** | In the *main* room at (0.0, 3.0), surface still empty (not visible from the chamber). |
| **key_4** | In the *main* room at (3.0, 1.0) (unchanged). |
| **Other objects** | No change. |

---

### Assumptions made *before* the move

| # | Assumption | Result |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | The door cell is traversable (no obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – potato remains in inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door remains open while stepping through it. | **Proved right** – `door_6` is still open/unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not affect any other objects (chest, box, key, table). | **Proved right** – all other objects retain their previous states. |

---

### New (still untested) assumptions in the **chamber**

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From the door cell I can walk to `shelf_10` (0.0, 0.0) without obstruction. |
| A2️⃣ | I can still access the open `chest_9` if I need to (e.g., to verify it’s empty). |
| A3️⃣ | Returning to the *main* room later will again be possible through the same door. |

These will be verified by the next navigation or interaction actions.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the node is completed.**  
The last reflection shows that the action *“go through door_6 into chamber”* succeeded: the agent is now on the chamber‑side of door_6 (location (0.0, 1.0)), the door remains open and unlocked, and the inventory (potato 7) is unchanged. Therefore the intended step “go through door_6” has been achieved.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: **Yes, the node is completed.**  
The last reflection shows that the action *“go through door_6 into chamber”* succeeded: the agent is now on the chamber‑side of door_6 (location (0.0, 1.0)), the door remains open and unlocked, and the inventory (potato 7) is unchanged. Therefore the intended step “go through door_6” has been achieved.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – *go through door_6 into the main room***  

| Fact | Value after the action |
|------|------------------------|
| **Location** | (0.0 , 1.0) **in the *main* room** (the cell occupied by `door_6`). |
| **Room** | *main* (size 5 × 5). |
| **Inventory** | Contains **potato 7** (still being carried). |
| **door_6** | Position (0.0 , 1.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **shelf_10 / chest_9** | Still at (0.0 , 0.0) **in the *chamber***; the chest is **open** and **empty**. |
| **box_11** | At (0.0 , 2.0) **in the chamber**, still holds **diamond 8**. |
| **table_5** | At (0.0 , 3.0) **in the main room**, surface is empty. |
| **key_4** | At (3.0 , 1.0) **in the main room**. |
| **Other objects** | No change. |

### Assumptions made **before** the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The door cell is traversable (no obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – potato remains in inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door stays open while stepping through it. | **Proved right** – `door_6` is still open/unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not alter the state of any other objects (chest, box, key, table). | **Proved right** – all other objects unchanged. |
| 5️⃣ | The doorway leads to the *main* room at the same coordinates, and that cell is free. | **Proved right** – now in the main room at (0.0, 1.0). |

---

### New (still untested) assumptions about the **current** state

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (0.0, 1.0) I can walk to the table at (0.0, 3.0) without obstruction. |
| A2️⃣ | The table will accept `potato_7` when I issue `place potato_7 on table_5`. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden traps/locks will appear on the door while I stand on its cell. |
| A4️⃣ | The open chest in the chamber remains open/empty after I leave the chamber. |

These will be verified by the next navigation and placement actions.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – the focused plan node is **not** completed.

**Reasoning:** After the last action you are at (0.0, 1.0) in the main room, while `table_5` is located at (0.0, 3.0). You have not yet reached the table’s coordinates, so the “go to table_5” step is still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No – the focused plan node is **not** completed.

**Reasoning:** After the last action you are at (0.0, 1.0) in the main room, while `table_5` is located at (0.0, 3.0). You have not yet reached the table’s coordinates, so the “go to table_5” step is still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The current location is (0.0, 1.0) in the main room, while table_5 is at (0.0, 3.0). The agent has not yet arrived at the table, so the 'go to table_5' plan node is still pending.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the plan still looks promising.**  

- You’re already in the main room at (0.0, 1.0) and the table is at (0.0, 3.0), directly north along the same column.  
- No obstacles, doors, or locked cells have been reported between those coordinates, and the door you just passed through remains open.  
- The only step needed is to move two cells north (e.g., `move (0.0, 1.0) → (0.0, 2.0)` then `move (0.0, 2.0) → (0.0, 3.0)`) to reach the table, after which you can place the potato.

So continuing with “go to table_5” is a viable next action.

Reasoning: **Yes, the plan still looks promising.**  

- You’re already in the main room at (0.0, 1.0) and the table is at (0.0, 3.0), directly north along the same column.  
- No obstacles, doors, or locked cells have been reported between those coordinates, and the door you just passed through remains open.  
- The only step needed is to move two cells north (e.g., `move (0.0, 1.0) → (0.0, 2.0)` then `move (0.0, 2.0) → (0.0, 3.0)`) to reach the table, after which you can place the potato.

So continuing with “go to table_5” is a viable next action.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[observer] **Observed facts**

- I am in the **main** room at position **(4.0, 4.0)** – the same cell occupied by **door 6**, which is **open** and **unlocked**.  
- My inventory still contains **potato 7**.  
- Visible objects in this room:  
  - **table 5** at **(0.0, 3.0)**, its surface is **empty**.  
  - **key 4** at **(3.0, 1.0)**.  

No other objects have changed or appeared. This confirms the starting conditions for moving toward the table.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “move (4.0, 4.0) → (3.0, 4.0)”**

| Fact | Value after the move |
|------|----------------------|
| **Location** | (3.0 , 4.0) in the **main** room (the cell directly west of the doorway). |
| **Room** | *main* (5 × 5). |
| **Inventory** | Still contains **potato 7**. |
| **door_6** | Still at (4.0 , 4.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **table_5** | At (0.0 , 3.0), surface still **empty** (not yet reached). |
| **key_4** | At (3.0 , 1.0), unchanged. |
| **Other objects** | Chest 9, shelf 10, box 11, diamond 8 remain where they were in the *chamber*; no new objects appear. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The target square (3.0, 4.0) is traversable (no obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded and I now occupy that cell. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – potato 7 is still in the inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door will stay open while I step away from its cell. | **Proved right** – `door_6` remains open/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0). |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not affect any other objects (table, key, chest, etc.). | **Proved right** – all other objects retain their previous states. |

No assumption was contradicted.

---

### New (still untested) assumptions after the move

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (3.0, 4.0) I can continue westward toward (0.0, 4.0) and then south to reach the table at (0.0, 3.0) without hitting a wall or obstacle. |
| A2️⃣ | The table will accept `potato_7` when I later issue `place potato_7 on table_5`. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden trap or lock will appear on the door while I am standing away from it. |
| A4️⃣ | The open chest in the chamber will stay open/empty after I finish the whole task. |

These will be verified by the next navigation and placement actions.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The current location is **(3.0, 4.0)** in the *main* room.  
- The target object **table 5** is at **(0.0, 3.0)**.  
- I have not yet moved onto that cell, nor have I performed any action that would place the potato on the table.  

Therefore the focused plan node **“go to table_5”** is **not** completed. It still requires further navigation (e.g., moving west to (0.0, 4.0) and then south to (0.0, 3.0)).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The current location is **(3.0, 4.0)** in the *main* room.  
- The target object **table 5** is at **(0.0, 3.0)**.  
- I have not yet moved onto that cell, nor have I performed any action that would place the potato on the table.  

Therefore the focused plan node **“go to table_5”** is **not** completed. It still requires further navigation (e.g., moving west to (0.0, 4.0) and then south to (0.0, 3.0)).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The current location is (3.0, 4.0) in the main room, while table_5 is at (0.0, 3.0). The agent has not yet reached the table nor placed the potato on it, so the plan node "go to table_5" is still pending.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
All known observations indicate that the squares between your current position (3.0, 4.0) and the table at (0.0, 3.0) are free: the door is open, there are no walls or other objects in the way, and the table’s surface is empty. Continuing westward and then southward will bring you to the table, after which you can place the potato.

**Next sensible step:**

Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
All known observations indicate that the squares between your current position (3.0, 4.0) and the table at (0.0, 3.0) are free: the door is open, there are no walls or other objects in the way, and the table’s surface is empty.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move (3.0, 4.0) → (2.0, 4.0))**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Location** | (2.0 , 4.0) in the *main* room |
| **Room** | *main* (5 × 5) |
| **Inventory** | still contains **potato 7** |
| **door 6** | at (4.0 , 4.0), **open**, **unlocked** (unchanged) |
| **table 5** | at (0.0 , 3.0), surface **empty** (still not reached) |
| **key 4** | at (3.0 , 1.0) (unchanged) |
| **All other objects** (shelf 10, chest 9, box 11, diamond 8) remain where they were in the *chamber* and are not visible from the current cell. |

---

### Assumptions tested by this move  

| # | Assumption (pre‑move) | Result |
|---|------------------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | The target square (2.0, 4.0) is traversable (no obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded, I now occupy that cell. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – **potato 7** is still in the inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door will stay open while I step away from its cell. | **Proved right** – **door 6** remains open/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0). |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not affect any other objects (table, key, chest, etc.). | **Proved right** – all other objects retain their previous states. |

No assumption was contradicted.

---

### New (still untested) assumptions after the move  

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (2.0, 4.0) I can continue westward to (0.0, 4.0) and then south to reach the table at (0.0, 3.0) without hitting a wall or obstacle. |
| A2️⃣ | When I later issue `place potato_7 on table_5`, the table will accept the potato. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden trap or lock will appear on **door 6** while I am standing away from it. |
| A4️⃣ | The open chest in the chamber will stay open/empty after I finish the whole task. |

These will be verified by the next navigation and placement actions.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**

The current focused plan node is “go to table_5”.  
- My position is (2.0, 4.0).  
- Table 5 is located at (0.0, 3.0).  
- I have not reached the table’s cell (or a cell adjacent to it) yet; the next moves westward are still pending.

**Conclusion:** The “go to table_5” node is **not completed**. It still requires further movement toward the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

The current focused plan node is “go to table_5”.  
- My position is (2.0, 4.0).  
- Table 5 is located at (0.0, 3.0).  
- I have not reached the table’s cell (or a cell adjacent to it) yet; the next moves westward are still pending.

**Conclusion:** The “go to table_5” node is **not completed**. It still requires further movement toward the table.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node is to go to table_5 located at (0.0, 3.0). Current location is (2.0, 4.0); the table has not been reached yet, so the node is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The node is still unfinished, but nothing so far suggests it can’t be finished. From (2.0, 4.0) the table is two cells west and one cell south, and all squares you’ve traversed have been free. Assuming the room is empty of hidden obstacles, the path to (0.0, 4.0) and then to (0.0, 3.0) should be viable. So the plan remains promising.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node is to go to table_5 located at (0.0, 3.0). Current location is (2.0, 4.0); the table has not been reached yet, so the node is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The node is still unfinished, but nothing so far suggests it can’t be finished. From (2.0, 4.0) the table is two cells west and one cell south, and all squares you’ve traversed have been free. Assuming the room is empty of hidden obstacles, the path to (0.0, 4.0) and then to (0.0, 3.0) should be viable. So the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – `move (2.0, 4.0) → (1.0, 4.0)`**

| Fact | Value after the move |
|------|----------------------|
| **Location** | (1.0 , 4.0) in the *main* room |
| **Room** | *main* (5 × 5) |
| **Inventory** | still contains **potato 7** |
| **door 6** | at (4.0 , 4.0), **open** & **unlocked** (unchanged) |
| **table 5** | at (0.0 , 3.0), surface **empty** |
| **key 4** | at (3.0 , 1.0) (unchanged) |
| **All other objects** (shelf 10, chest 9, box 11, diamond 8) remain in the *chamber* and are not visible. |

---

### Assumptions that were in force before the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The target cell (1.0, 4.0) is traversable (no wall/obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded and I now occupy that cell. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – **potato 7** is still in the inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The door will stay open while I step away from its cell. | **Proved right** – **door 6** remains open/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0). |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not alter any other objects (table, key, chest, etc.). | **Proved right** – all other objects retain their previous states. |

No assumption was contradicted.

---

### New (still untested) assumptions after the move

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (1.0, 4.0) I can continue west to (0.0, 4.0) and then south to reach the table at (0.0, 3.0) without hitting a wall or obstacle. |
| A2️⃣ | When I later issue `place potato_7 on table_5`, the table will accept the potato. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden trap or lock will appear on **door 6** while I am standing away from it. |
| A4️⃣ | The open chest in the chamber will stay open/empty after I finish the whole task. |

These will be verified by the next navigation and placement actions.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The last reflected state shows you are at (1.0, 4.0) still carrying the potato, while the table is at (0.0, 3.0). You haven’t reached the table yet, so the “go to table_5” node is still incomplete.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No. The last reflected state shows you are at (1.0, 4.0) still carrying the potato, while the table is at (0.0, 3.0). You haven’t reached the table yet, so the “go to table_5” node is still incomplete.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The current location is (1.0, 4.0) while the table is at (0.0, 3.0); the plan to go to table_5 has not been completed yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent has already reached the column of the table (x = 0) except for one more step west, and then one step south to the table’s coordinate (0, 3). No walls or obstacles have been observed, and the door remains open, so the path is still clear. The goal of reaching the table is therefore still reachable and the plan remains promising.

**Decision:** ✅ Continue with the plan – move to the table and then place the potato.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The current location is (1.0, 4.0) while the table is at (0.0, 3.0); the plan to go to table_5 has not been completed yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The agent has already reached the column of the table (x = 0) except for one more step west, and then one step south to the table’s coordinate (0, 3). No walls or obstacles have been observed, and the door remains open, so the path is still clear. The goal of reaching the table is therefore still reachable and the plan remains promising.

**Decision:** ✅ Continue with the plan – move to the table and then place the potato.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – `move (1.0, 4.0) → (0.0, 4.0)`**

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Location** | (0.0 , 4.0) in the **main** room |
| **Room** | *main* (5 × 5) |
| **Inventory** | still contains **potato 7** |

### Assumptions that were in force **before** the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Cell (0.0, 4.0) is traversable (no wall/obstacle). | **Proved right** – the move succeeded, I now occupy that cell. |
| 2️⃣ | Carrying the potato does not cause it to be dropped automatically. | **Proved right** – **potato 7** is still in inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | Stepping away from the door does **not** close or lock it. | **Proved right** – `door_6` remains open/unlocked at (4.0, 4.0). |
| 4️⃣ | Moving does not affect any other objects (table, key, chest, etc.). | **Proved right** – all other objects retain their previous states. |

No assumption was contradicted.

---

### New (still untested) assumptions after the move

| # | Assumption |
|---|------------|
| A1️⃣ | From (0.0, 4.0) I can move **south** to (0.0, 3.0) and stand on the table without hitting a wall or obstacle. |
| A2️⃣ | The table will accept `potato_7` when I later issue `place potato_7 on table_5`. |
| A3️⃣ | No hidden trap/lock will appear on **door_6** while I am standing away from it. |
| A4️⃣ | The open chest in the chamber will stay open/empty after I finish the whole task. |

These will be verified by the next navigation step (moving onto the table) and the placement command.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflected action placed you at **(0.0, 4.0)**, which is one cell north of the table’s location **(0.0, 3.0)**. The plan node “go to table_5” requires you to reach the table’s cell (or stand on it). Since you are still one step away, the node is **not yet completed**. You need to move south to (0.0, 3.0) before the plan step can be considered done.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: The last reflected action placed you at **(0.0, 4.0)**, which is one cell north of the table’s location **(0.0, 3.0)**. The plan node “go to table_5” requires you to reach the table’s cell (or stand on it). Since you are still one step away, the node is **not yet completed**. You need to move south to (0.0, 3.0) before the plan step can be considered done.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node 'go to table_5' requires the agent to be at the table's location (0.0, 3.0). After the last move the agent is at (0.0, 4.0), which is one cell north of the table, so the node is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**  
The goal of the node *go to table_5* is to stand on the table’s cell (0.0, 3.0).  
You are currently at (0.0, 4.0), directly north of the table, and all visible cells around you are free (no walls, doors, or other objects blocking the way). A single move **south** to (0.0, 3.0) will satisfy the node.

**Conclusion** – The node is still promising; you just need to move one step south onto the table.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node 'go to table_5' requires the agent to be at the table's location (0.0, 3.0). After the last move the agent is at (0.0, 4.0), which is one cell north of the table, so the node is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**  
The goal of the node *go to table_5* is to stand on the table’s cell (0.0, 3.0).  
You are currently at (0.0, 4.0), directly north of the table, and all visible cells around you are free (no walls, doors, or other objects blocking the way). A single move **south** to (0.0, 3.0) will satisfy the node.

**Conclusion** – The node is still promising; you just need to move one step south onto the table.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.
