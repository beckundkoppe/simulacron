[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5,1.5), directly east of the table (3.5,0.5). No obstacles block the path to the cucumber or table. The chest is closed and empty, unrelated to the task.

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Moved to (3.5,1.5), now at the cucumber's location.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Cucumber is here (no obstacles blocked the path).  

**Assumptions:**  
- Path to cucumber was clear (proven correct).  
- Cucumber is pickable (assumed true, not yet tested).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Path clarity was correct.  
**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber's pickability (next step: pick it up).

Cucumber is already in your reachable area; proceed to pick it up.
