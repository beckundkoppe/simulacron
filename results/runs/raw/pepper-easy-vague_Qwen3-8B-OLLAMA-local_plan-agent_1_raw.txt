Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] To resolve the situation, follow these steps:

1. **Collect Pepper 4**: Since you've already collected pepper_3, now move to the location of pepper_4 and collect it.  
   - **Action**: Move to pepper_4's position (assuming it's at a specific coordinate, e.g., (x, y)) and pick it up.

2. **Navigate to the Table**: Once both peppers are in your inventory, head to the table's location.  
   - **Assumed Table Position**: If the table is at (3.5, 0.5), move there from your current position (3.0, 1.5).

3. **Place the Peppers**:  
   - **Step 1**: Place pepper_3 on the table.  
   - **Step 2**: Place pepper_4 on the table.  

4. **Completion**: Confirm both peppers are on the table. If the task requires further steps, proceed accordingly.  

**Key Takeaway**: Avoid repetitive loops of thought. Focus on actionable steps: collect, move, and place. If the table's location or pepper positions are unclear, clarify them first. Once both peppers are collected, the placement is straightforward.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observation:**  
- **Inventory:** Contains **pepper_3** and **pepper_4**.  
- **Table** at (3.5, 0.5) has **pepper_5**.  
- **Current Position:** (3.0, 1.5).  

**New Discovery:**  
You are at (3.0, 1.5) with both peppers in inventory. The table is at (3.5, 0.5). Move right to (3.5, 1.5) then down to the table to place both peppers.  

**Action:** Move to the table.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. **Move right** to (3.5, 1.5).  
2. **Move down** to (3.5, 0.5) (table position).  
3. **Place pepper_3** and **pepper_4** on the table.  

**Final Answer:**

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Moved to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Facts:**  
- **Inventory:** Contains **pepper_3** and **pepper_4**.  
- **Table:** Contains **pepper_5**.  
- **Current Position:** Table (3.5, 0.5).  

**Assumptions about New State:**  
- Placing **pepper_3** and **pepper_4** on the table will succeed.  
- Table remains valid for placing all peppers (no conflicts).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Movement to the table succeeded.  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- Placement of **pepper_3** and **pepper_4** will succeed.  

**Next Steps:** Place both peppers on the table.  

**Final Answer:**  
Place **pepper_3** and **pepper_4** on the table.
