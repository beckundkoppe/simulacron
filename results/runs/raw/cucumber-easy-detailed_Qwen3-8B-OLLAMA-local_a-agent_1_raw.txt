[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Agent moved to (3.5, 1.5), where the cucumber is located.  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5), directly below the cucumber.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The cucumber is pickable and not obstructed.  
- The agent can pick up the cucumber and move it to the table.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Movement to the cucumber’s location succeeded.  
- The cucumber is not already on the table (confirmed by its y-coordinate).  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- Whether the cucumber is physically accessible (e.g., no obstacles).  
- Whether the agent’s inventory can hold the cucumber.  

**Next Steps:**  
Pick up the cucumber, then move to the table to place it.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
- **Cucumber is now in the agent's inventory.**  
- **Agent remains at (3.5, 1.5).**  

**New Facts:**  
- Cucumber is no longer at (3.5, 1.5) (picked up).  
- Inventory contains cucumber_3.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- **Inventory capacity:** Validated (no overflow).  
- **Cucumber accessibility:** Validated (no obstacles).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- "Cucumber is pickable and not obstructed" → **Correct**.  
- "Agent’s inventory can hold the cucumber" → **Correct**.  

**Next Step:** Move to (3.5, 0.5) to place the cucumber on the table.
