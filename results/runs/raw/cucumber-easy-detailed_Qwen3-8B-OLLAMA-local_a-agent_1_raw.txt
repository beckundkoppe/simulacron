[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5) in the main room. The table (table_4) is at (3.5, 0.5) with empty contents. Both objects are in the same x-position but different y-positions. The human is at (0.0, 0.0).

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to (3.5, 1.5) to pick up the cucumber.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.5,1.5)
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Human moved to (3.5, 1.5) and collected the cucumber.  
- Table (table_4) is at (3.5, 0.5), empty.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The cucumber is now in the human's inventory.  
- The table is reachable from the current position (same x, lower y).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- The cucumber's location was correct (movement succeeded).  
- The table's position is valid (same x-coordinate, accessible via movement).  

**Unresolved:**  
- Need to move to (3.5, 0.5) to place the cucumber on the table.
