Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**
- Pepper was moved from table_6 to pepper_3 container
- Pepper was collected from pepper_3 
- Pepper was moved from pepper_3 to table_6
- Pepper was dropped into table_6

**Facts:**
- Pepper exists in the environment
- There are containers (pepper_3, table_6) 
- The robot can move between locations
- The robot can take/drop objects

**Assumptions:**
- Pepper_3 is a container that can hold pepper
- Table_6 is a valid drop location
- The robot can collect objects from containers

**Verification:**
- ✅ Assumption proved right: Containers work, robot can move and manipulate objects
- ❌ Assumption proved wrong: The action "take from itself" failed, indicating the robot cannot take objects from their own location without specifying a container

The final state shows pepper successfully moved from table_6 to pepper_3 and back to table_6, but the robot learned it needs to specify container IDs for taking objects.

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**
- Robot moved from pepper_4 (3.0,1.5) to pepper_5 (3.5,1.0) location

**Facts:**
- Robot is now at pepper_5 position (3.5,1.0)
- Pepper_5 exists at that location
- Robot inventory contains pepper_3 (from previous collection)

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Robot can move between locations
- Robot can navigate to specific positions

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- None - movement was successful

**New state:** Robot positioned at pepper_5 location, ready to collect it.
