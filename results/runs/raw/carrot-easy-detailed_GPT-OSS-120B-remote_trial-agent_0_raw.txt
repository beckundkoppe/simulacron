Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Reflection on the performed action**

- **Effect of the action:** The only change that actually occurred was that the human moved from (0.5, 0.5) to the location of `table_3` (1.0, 4.0).  
- **Facts after the action:**  
  * Human position = (1.0, 4.0) (at the table).  
  * Inventory still contains `carrot_4`.  
  * `table_3` surface is still empty.  
- **Assumption made:** I assumed that simply moving to the table would also place the carrot there.  
- **Outcome:** The assumption was **incorrect**; the carrot remains in the inventory and the table is still empty.

**Next minimal action to achieve the goal**

Now that the human is already standing at the table, the smallest remaining step is to put the carrot onto the table’s surface.

**Action:** `place carrot_4 on table_3`

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is completed.**  
The human was already at the table, and the last action `place carrot_4 on table_3` puts the carrot from the inventory onto the table’s surface. After that action the carrot is on the table and no longer in the inventory, which satisfies the goal. No further steps are required.
