Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- The human is now at position **(3.5, 1.5)** – the exact location of `cucumber_3`.  
- The inventory is still **empty** (no object has been taken).  
- `cucumber_3` remains at **(3.5, 1.5)**, untouched.  
- `table_4` is still at **(3.5, 0.5)** with no contents.

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *The human could walk straight to the cucumber’s coordinates.* – **Correct.** The move succeeded and the agent is now there.  
2. *Moving does not automatically pick up the cucumber.* – **Correct.** Inventory is still empty.  
3. *The cucumber’s position stays the same while walking.* – **Correct.** It is still at (3.5, 1.5).  

No assumptions turned out wrong; the only remaining steps are to **take** the cucumber and then **place** it on `table_4`.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- The human’s inventory now contains **cucumber 3**.  
- `cucumber_3` is **no longer** at position (3.5, 1.5); it has been removed from the world map.  
- The human’s position is still **(3.5, 1.5)** (the spot where the cucumber was).  
- `table_4` remains at **(3.5, 0.5)** and is still empty.  

**Assumptions about the new state**

- *The cucumber can be taken* – proved correct; the take action succeeded.  
- *Taking an object moves it from the world into the inventory* – proved correct; the cucumber disappeared from the floor.  
- *No other objects or doors are affected by the take action* – holds true; everything else is unchanged.  

All assumptions made for this step were validated.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Current facts**

- Human is at position **(3.5, 0.5)** (the table’s location).  
- Human’s inventory contains **cucumber 3**.  
- `cucumber_3` is no longer on the floor; it is being held.  
- `table_4` is still at **(3.5, 0.5)** and is empty (the cucumber has not yet been placed).  

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. *Moving does not automatically drop carried items.* – still valid.  
2. *The table can accept objects placed on it.* – still assumed true.  
3. *The inventory can hold the cucumber while standing on the table.* – still assumed true.  

**Which assumptions were validated**

- Moving to the table succeeded and did not affect the inventory (assumption 1).  
- The cucumber remained in the inventory after the move (assumption 3).  

No assumption turned out to be wrong.
