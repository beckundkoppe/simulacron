[planner] # Initial Plan: Place the carrot on the table

## Goal: Place the carrot on the table

## Steps:
1. **Locate the carrot** - Find where the carrot is currently positioned
2. **Move to the carrot** - Walk or navigate to the carrot's location
3. **Pick up the carrot** - Grasp and lift the carrot from its current position
4. **Navigate to the table** - Walk or move to the table's location
5. **Place the carrot on the table** - Lower the carrot onto the table surface
6. **Verify completion** - Confirm the carrot is properly positioned on the table

## Assumptions:
- The carrot exists and is accessible
- The table exists and is stable
- I have the ability to move and manipulate objects
- The carrot is not already on the table

## Next Action:
Locate the carrot first.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your current plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I observe that I am in the main room at position (0.5, 0.5). I am currently holding the carrot in my inventory. The table is located at position (1.0, 4.0) and is empty. The carrot is already in my hands, so I need to move to the table and place it down.

The relevant fact for my current plan step is that I need to move from my current position (0.5, 0.5) toward the table at (1.0, 4.0) to place the carrot.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to the table at (1.0, 4.0) since I am currently holding the carrot and need to place it on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
