content='After considering various approaches, and given the constraints of the available functions, the primary actionable command based on the task is the movement itself. Facing direction might be implied through movement context in a 2D plane without an explicit function for orientation.\n\nThus, the tool calls needed are:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_position": {"x": "2.0", "y": "0.8"}}\n```\n\nHowever, to fully comply with the task request including facing north after movement (assuming this requires separate handling not directly supported by current tools), additional steps cannot be represented.\n\nGiven that, and under the assumption that positional movement suffices to represent orientation in this context:\n\nFinal answer consists solely of the `move_to_position` command directed towards coordinates (2.0, 0.8).\n\nBut upon re-reading: if we\'re to plan actions for moving AND facing north, but no tools enable orientation except positioning, then perhaps a sequence is expected like:\n\n1.

content='Based on the above reasoning, here is the toolcall for moving towards the cucumber:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\nBut wait, looking back at the function definitions, `move_to_position` seems to directly move to coordinates without needing to know about objects. Given that both actions would result in moving the human to the same position (since the cucumber is at 3.5,1.5), but since we are asked specifically to move towards the cucumber object, not just any position, it\'s semantically more correct to use `move_to_object`.\n\nHowever, if `move_to_position` and `move_to_object` both achieve the same effect (just different ways of specifying the target), and task is to provide toolcalls arising from action plan ("move towards cucumber"), then using object_id directly reflects that intent better.\n\nThus final toolcall is as above.\n\nBut looking at the problem again, it says:\n\n"Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action. The planned action here is "Move towards cucumber". So we need tool calls that result in moving to cucumber\'s position. Any valid sequence that achieves this is acceptable, but preferably most direct.\n\nGiven both functions can achieve this, which one to choose? Problem mentions no constraints on movement (like step size), so single function call suffices.\n\nBetween the two approaches:\n1) move_to_position x=3.5 y=1.5\n2) move_to_object object_id="cucumber_3"\n\nBoth would result in human at cucumber\'s position in a direct manner, assuming no intermediate steps needed (like obstacles not mentioned in problem).\n\nSince both are valid and achieve same outcome in given context, but second option more directly reflects semantics of moving to an object rather than coordinates, likely preferred.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\nBut wait, there\'s also a mention in `move_to_object`\'s description: "The human moves to a position." same as first function. Maybe it was meant to say "move towards object", but if both functions have identical descriptions and different parameters, likely one is deprecated or they do same thing.\n\nIn absence of more context, safest is to use new style `move_to_object` which seems designed for moving relative to objects rather than arbitrary positions.\n\nThus final answer is:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\texttt{move\\_to\\_object}}' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2789, 'prompt_tokens': 1335, 'total_tokens': 4124, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-351', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0294-0ff8-7202-bab6-8c6e66578e2a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1335, 'output_tokens': 2789, 'total_tokens': 4124, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
            

content='Based on the above reasoning, the necessary toolcall is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    "tool_calls": [\n        {\n            "function": {\n                "name": "move_to_position",\n                "parameters": {\n                    "x": "3.5",\n                    "y": "1.5"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Summary:\nThe task is to move the human from their current position (0.0, 0.0) to the target position (3.5, 1.5). No intermediate actions are required as the path is direct and free of obstacles that need interaction. The solution involves a single tool call: moving to the specified coordinates.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    "tool_calls": [\n        {\n            "function": {\n                "name": "move_to_position",\n                "parameters": {\n                    "x": "3.5",\n                    "y": "1.5"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n`' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 697, 'prompt_tokens': 1340, 'total_tokens': 2037, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-388', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b029a-4e44-7e83-b9a8-b947bcd77613-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1340, 'output_tokens': 697, 'total_tokens': 2037, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
