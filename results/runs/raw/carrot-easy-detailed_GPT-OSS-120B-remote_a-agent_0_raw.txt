[observer] I see that I’m in the “main” room at (0.5, 0.5). My inventory holds a carrot (carrot_4). There’s an empty table (table_3) at position (1.0, 4.0).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- **Location:** The human is now standing at the table’s position (1.0, 4.0).  
- **Inventory:** Still contains the carrot (carrot_4).  
- **Table:** Remains empty (no object has been put on it yet).  

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. *Assumption:* Moving to the table would automatically place the carrot on it.  
   - **Result:** **Incorrect** – the carrot is still in the inventory; placement has not occurred.  

2. *Assumption:* The table’s coordinates are reachable from the current position.  
   - **Result:** **Correct** – the move succeeded and the agent is now at the table.  

3. *Assumption:* No other objects or obstacles would block the move.  
   - **Result:** **Correct** – the movement was unimpeded.  

**Summary:** The only effect of the executed action was a change of location; the carrot remains unplaced, so a separate “place/put” action is still required to fulfill the original goal.
