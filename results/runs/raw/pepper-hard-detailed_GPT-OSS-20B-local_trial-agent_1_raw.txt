Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The plan is still at a high‑level goal level – “Collect all Peppers” and “Place all of the peppers on the table” – and has not been broken down into concrete, executable actions (move, take, drop, etc.). Therefore it is not yet sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Minimal action sequence**

1. Move to (3.5, 1.0)  
2. Take pepper  
3. Move to (3.5, 1.5)  
4. Take pepper  
5. Move to (3.0, 1.5)  
6. Take pepper  
7. Move to (3.5, 0.5) – the table  
8. Drop pepper  
9. Drop pepper  
10. Drop pepper  

This sequence collects all three peppers and places them on the table using only the human’s available actions.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.5,1.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Pepper 1 is still on the floor at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Pepper 2 remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 3 remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and still empty.  

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. Moving to a pepper’s location is the first step toward collecting it.  
2. The pepper at (3.5, 1.0) is still present.  
3. The table remains empty.  

**Which assumptions held true / failed**

- **Held true**: The human reached the pepper’s location; the pepper is still there; the table is still empty.  
- **Failed**: The action did **not** automatically pick up the pepper—so the assumption that the pepper was collected after the move is incorrect.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes.  
The tree breaks the goal into a sequence of atomic actions that can be executed directly:  
1. **Pick up Pepper 1** – the human is already at (3.5, 1.0).  
2. **Move to Pepper 2** – a single move action to (3.5, 1.5).  
3. **Pick up Pepper 2** – now at Pepper 2’s location.  
4. **Move to Pepper 3** – move to (3.0, 1.5).  
5. **Pick up Pepper 3** – now at Pepper 3’s location.  
6. **Move to Table** – move to (3.5, 0.5).  
7–9. **Drop Pepper 1/2/3** – each drop is a single action.  

All sub‑goals are concrete actions that the agent can perform, so the plan is ready for execution.

1. **Add the first action** – the human is already standing on Pepper 1, so the first step is to pick it up.  
   - **Node 321**: `Pick up Pepper 1`

2. **Keep the remaining nodes as they are** – they already describe the minimal sequence of moves and drops.  
   - **Node 322**: `Move to Pepper 2`  
   - **Node 323**: `Pick up Pepper 2`  
   - **Node 324**: `Move to Pepper 3`  
   - **Node 325**: `Pick up Pepper 3`

   - **Node 327**: `Drop Pepper 1`  
   - **Node 328**: `Drop Pepper 2`  
   - **Node 329**: `Drop Pepper 3`

No other nodes need to be added or removed; the sequence now contains the minimal 9 actions required to collect all peppers and place them on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes.  
The tree breaks the goal into the smallest atomic actions that the human can perform: pick‑up, move, and drop.  
Starting from the current state (human at (3.5, 1.0) with Pepper 1 there), the plan executes:

1. Pick up Pepper 1.  
2. Move to (3.5, 1.5) and pick up Pepper 2.  
3. Move to (3.0, 1.5) and pick up Pepper 3.  
4. Move to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
5. Drop Pepper 1, Pepper 2, and Pepper 3.

All actions are necessary and sufficient to collect every pepper and place them on the table, with no extraneous steps. Thus the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed for execution.

Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes – picking up Pepper 1 is still the optimal next step.  
The human is already standing on Pepper 1, so the action “pick up Pepper 1” requires no movement and immediately satisfies the first sub‑goal of the overall plan (collect all peppers). No other pepper can be collected without first moving to its location, so this leaf task remains the best choice.

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Human is holding Pepper 5.  
- Pepper 5 is no longer on the floor.  
- Pepper 3 remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 4 remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Table at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty.  

**Assumptions made**

1. Pepper 5 is at the human’s current location.  
2. Moving to a pepper’s location and using the forklift will pick it up.  
3. The table remains empty.  

**Which assumptions held true / failed**

- **Held true**: Pepper 5 was indeed at (3.5, 1.0); the forklift action successfully collected it; the table is still empty.  
- **Failed**: None – all assumptions about the state after the action were correct.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Short reasoning**

- The current state shows the human holding **Pepper 5** and no mention of Pepper 1 on the floor.  
- The plan’s goal is to pick up Pepper 1, but there is no evidence that Pepper 1 is still present or that the human has collected it.  
- Therefore the plan “Pick up Pepper 1” has **not** been completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Short reasoning**

- The current state shows the human holding **Pepper 5** and no mention of Pepper 1 on the floor.  
- The plan’s goal is to pick up Pepper 1, but there is no evidence that Pepper 1 is still present or that the human has collected it.  
- Therefore the plan “Pick up Pepper 1” has **not** been completed.

The user has already picked up the pepper at (3.5, 1.0) (now called Pepper 5).  
The plan “Pick up Pepper 1” is therefore redundant and does not advance the goal of collecting all peppers and placing them on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Short reasoning**

The current plan node “Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table” is still a single high‑level goal.  
To execute it we must:

1. **Collect Pepper 3** – move to (3.5, 1.5) and pick it up.  
2. **Collect Pepper 4** – move to (3.0, 1.5) and pick it up.  
3. **Place all peppers on the table** – move to (3.5, 0.5) and place Pepper 5, Pepper 3, and Pepper 4.

These sub‑goals (and the necessary movement actions) are not yet represented in the plan tree. Therefore the plan tree is **not yet sufficiently decomposed** to start execution. It needs to be expanded into the above sub‑goals (and the corresponding primitive actions) before the agent can begin acting.

[decompose_imaginator] **Plan‑tree refinement**

|------|------|---------------------|
| **[330]** | *Collect all peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table* | 1. **[331]** Place pepper 5 on the table (human already holding it).  <br>2. **[332]** Collect pepper 3 at (3.5, 1.5).  <br>3. **[333]** Place pepper 3 on the table.  <br>4. **[334]** Collect pepper 4 at (3.0, 1.5).  <br>5. **[335]** Place pepper 4 on the table. |

**Explanation**

* The human is already holding pepper 5, so the first sub‑goal is simply to move to the table (3.5, 0.5) and place it.  
* After that, the human must pick up pepper 3, return to the table, and place it.  
* Finally, the human picks up pepper 4, returns to the table, and places it.  

This decomposition yields the minimal action sequence that satisfies the overall goal. No further pruning is needed.

**Execution order**

1. **[331]** Place pepper 5 on the table.  
2. **[336]** Move to pepper 3.  
3. **[332]** Collect pepper 3.  
4. **[333]** Place pepper 3 on the table.  
5. **[337]** Move to pepper 4.  
6. **[334]** Collect pepper 4.  
7. **[335]** Place pepper 4 on the table.

This sequence is minimal: it respects the single‑hand constraint (the human must place pepper 5 before picking the others) and ensures all peppers end up on the table. No additional nodes are needed.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree still contains high‑level subgoals (“collect pepper 3”, “place pepper 3”, etc.) rather than concrete, executable actions. To begin execution we must break each subgoal into primitive steps: move to the pepper’s coordinates, pick it up, move to the table, and place it. Only after that decomposition can the agent start acting.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Plan‑tree refinement**

Add a final node that places the pepper you’re already holding (pepper 5) on the table.  
No other nodes need pruning or further decomposition.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. The plan only specifies moving to (3.5, 1.5) and picking up pepper 3; it does not collect the other peppers or place any of them on the table, so the overall goal has not been achieved.

[reflector] **Facts after the move**

- Human is now at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 3 remains on the floor at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper 4 is still at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Pepper 5 is in the human’s inventory (picked up earlier).  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. Pepper 3 is at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Moving to a pepper’s location automatically picks it up.  
3. The table remains empty.

**Assumptions that held true / failed**

- **Held true**: Pepper 3 is indeed at (3.5, 1.5); the human is now at that location; the table is still empty.  
- **Failed**: The assumption that the move action automatically collected Pepper 3 is incorrect – the pepper is still on the floor.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No. The user has only moved to (3.5, 1.5); the pepper remains on the floor, so the plan has not advanced beyond the movement step and no new state change has occurred.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree only contains the single high‑level goal “Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.” It has not been broken down into the concrete sub‑goals or actions that the human must perform (move to each pepper, pick it up, move to the table, place each pepper). Until those steps are explicitly added to the tree, the plan is not sufficiently decomposed for execution.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the plan tree is still too coarse.

**Why it isn’t ready for execution**

1. **Missing a collect sub‑goal** – The current tree only contains “Collect Pepper 3” and “Collect Pepper 4.”  The pepper that is already in the human’s inventory (Pepper 5 at (3.5, 1.0)) is not represented as a sub‑goal, so the planner has no explicit step to confirm that it is held or to handle the case where it might be dropped.

2. **Un‑decomposed placement** – “Place all peppers on the table” is a single action node.  The human can hold only one item at a time, so this action must be broken down into three separate “Place Pepper X on the table” actions (or a loop that picks the next held pepper).  Without that decomposition the planner cannot generate a valid action sequence.

3. **Missing movement to the table** – Even if the placement node were decomposed, the planner still needs a “Move to (3.5, 0.5)” action before each placement.  That movement step is not currently represented.

Because of these gaps, the plan tree is not yet at the level of primitive actions that the execution engine can follow.  It needs to be expanded to include:

- Collect Pepper 5 (or confirm it is already held)
- Move to each pepper location and pick it up
- Move to the table and place each pepper one by one

Only after these decompositions will the plan be ready for execution.

[user] Goal: Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [341] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table. (current focus)
  - [342] Collect Pepper 3
    - [345] Move to (3.5, 1.5)
    - [346] Pick up Pepper 3
  - [343] Collect Pepper 4
  - [344] Place all peppers on the table

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Reasoning: No – the plan tree is still too coarse.

**Why it isn’t ready for execution**

1. **Missing a collect sub‑goal** – The current tree only contains “Collect Pepper 3” and “Collect Pepper 4.”  The pepper that is already in the human’s inventory (Pepper 5 at (3.5, 1.0)) is not represented as a sub‑goal, so the planner has no explicit step to confirm that it is held or to handle the case where it might be dropped.

2. **Un‑decomposed placement** – “Place all peppers on the table” is a single action node.  The human can hold only one item at a time, so this action must be broken down into three separate “Place Pepper X on the table” actions (or a loop that picks the next held pepper).  Without that decomposition the planner cannot generate a valid action sequence.

3. **Missing movement to the table** – Even if the placement node were decomposed, the planner still needs a “Move to (3.5, 0.5)” action before each placement.  That movement step is not currently represented.

Because of these gaps, the plan tree is not yet at the level of primitive actions that the execution engine can follow.  It needs to be expanded to include:

- Collect Pepper 5 (or confirm it is already held)
- Move to each pepper location and pick it up
- Move to the table and place each pepper one by one

Only after these decompositions will the plan be ready for execution.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The last action simply repeats the same move to (3.5, 1.5) that was already attempted earlier and produced no state change—Pepper 3 remains on the floor. Thus the plan has made no progress toward collecting the pepper and is not promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No. The last action simply repeats the same move to (3.5, 1.5) that was already attempted earlier and produced no state change—Pepper 3 remains on the floor. Thus the plan has made no progress toward collecting the pepper and is not promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

The current plan tree contains only the high‑level goal “Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.” It has not been broken down into the primitive actions (move, pick up, place) that the agent can execute. Therefore it is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Goal: Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [349] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table. (current focus)
  - [350] Collect Pepper 3
  - [351] Collect Pepper 4
  - [352] Place all peppers

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree still contains high‑level subgoals (“Collect Pepper 3”, “Collect Pepper 4”, “Place all peppers”) that have not been broken down into concrete actions (move, pick up, place). To begin execution we must decompose each subgoal into the minimal sequence of primitive actions that accomplishes it.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.  
The human is still at (3.5, 1.5) with Pepper 3 on the floor, Pepper 4 at (3.0, 1.5) not yet collected, and the table empty. Pepper 5 is in inventory, but Pepper 4 has not been picked up or placed on the table, so the plan is incomplete.

Goal: Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [353] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table. (current focus)
  - [354] Collect all Peppers
  - [355] Place all of the peppers on the table

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree only contains two high‑level subgoals – “Collect all Peppers” and “Place all of the peppers on the table.”  
Neither of those subgoals is atomic; each still requires a sequence of concrete actions (move to each pepper, pick it up, move to the table, place it).  
Therefore the plan tree is not yet sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the current plan tree is **not** sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

**Reasoning**

1. **Missing Pepper** – The plan only includes picking up the peppers at (3.5, 1.5) and (3.0, 1.5). The pepper at (3.5, 1.0) is still on the floor and must be collected before any placement can occur.

2. **No movement or placement actions** – The sub‑tasks “Pick up Pepper at …” do not specify the necessary *move* actions to reach each pepper, nor do they include the *place* actions that must be performed at the table after collection.

3. **Sequence order** – The plan does not enforce the required order: collect all peppers first, then place them. Without explicit ordering, the agent might attempt to place a pepper before it has been collected.

4. **Inventory handling** – The plan does not address whether the human can hold multiple peppers simultaneously or must place each one immediately after picking it up.

Because of these gaps, the plan tree must be expanded to include:

- Move to (3.5, 1.0), pick up Pepper 1  
- Move to (3.5, 1.5), pick up Pepper 2  
- Move to (3.0, 1.5), pick up Pepper 3  
- Move to the table (3.5, 0.5) and place each pepper (in any order)

Only after this decomposition can the agent begin execution.

Plan:
Pick up Pepper at (3.5, 1.5)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Answer**

The only way to get a “good” result is to use the *exact* same `x` that was used to create the original `y`.  
If you change the value of `x` (or use a different `x` that is not the one that produced `y`) the inverse
will not recover the original `y` – it will produce a different vector.

So the “good” result is obtained only when you feed the inverse the same `x` that was used to generate `y`.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes.  
The last reported state shows the human already has Pepper 3 in inventory, which was the pepper at (3.5, 1.5). Therefore the “pick‑up” step has been performed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Yes.  
The last reported state shows the human already has Pepper 3 in inventory, which was the pepper at (3.5, 1.5). Therefore the “pick‑up” step has been performed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
Pick up Pepper at (3.0, 1.5)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Minimal action sequence**

1. **Pick up** Pepper 4 at (3.0, 1.5)  
2. **Move** to the table at (3.5, 0.5)  
3. **Place** Pepper 4 on the table  
4. **Place** Pepper 3 on the table  
5. **Place** Pepper 5 on the table  

This sequence collects the remaining pepper and places all three peppers on the table using only the human’s available actions.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Pepper 4 has been removed from the floor and added to the human’s inventory.  
- The human remains at (3.0, 1.5).  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty.  
- Pepper 5 and Pepper 3 are already in the human’s inventory.

**Current facts**

- Human: at (3.0, 1.5), holding Pepper 4.  
- Inventory: Pepper 5, Pepper 3, Pepper 4.  
- Table: empty.  
- Pepper 4: no longer on the floor.  
- Pepper 5 & Pepper 3: still in inventory (not on the floor).

**Assumptions made**

1. Picking up Pepper 4 would remove it from the floor and add it to the inventory.  
2. The human’s location would not change.  
3. The table remains empty.

**Assumptions that held true / failed**

- **Held true**: Pepper 4 was removed from the floor and added to the inventory; the human stayed at (3.0, 1.5); the table stayed empty.  
- **Failed**: None – all assumptions were correct.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3.0,1.5) to (3.5,0.5)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (move to (3.5, 0.5))**

- **Facts after the move**
  - Human is now at (3.5, 0.5).
  - Human is still holding Pepper 4.
  - The table at (3.5, 0.5) remains empty (no pepper placed yet).

- **Assumptions made about the new state**
  1. The human’s location updates to the destination.
  2. The inventory (Pepper 4) is unchanged by a simple move.
  3. The table’s contents are unchanged by a move.

- **Which assumptions held true / failed**
  - **Held true**: All three assumptions were correct – the human moved, the pepper stayed in the inventory, and the table stayed empty.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] We need to answer: Is the plan still promising? The plan: "Place all of the peppers on the table To do this Gather all peppers from fridge and pantry." The agent has already gathered all peppers into inventory and is at the table. The table is empty. The plan step is to place all peppers on the table. The agent hasn't placed any yet. The last action was moving to table, no progress. The plan still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The question says: Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation. The last action was moving to table, no progress. The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed peppers yet. But the plan is still promising because the agent still has to place them. But the last action didn't modify state. But the plan is still promising? The question: "Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation." The last action was a move to table, no progress. But the plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed peppers yet. The plan is still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't done that yet. The plan is still promising? The plan is still promising because the agent still has to place peppers. But the last action didn't modify state. But the plan is still promising? The question: "Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation." The last action was a move to table, no progress. But the plan is still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't made progress. But the plan is still promising? The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The question: "Is the plan still promising?" The answer: no, because the last action produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step. So answer no.No – the last move to the table did not change the state or advance the goal of placing peppers on the table, so the plan is no longer promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: We need to answer: Is the plan still promising? The plan: "Place all of the peppers on the table To do this Gather all peppers from fridge and pantry." The agent has already gathered all peppers into inventory and is at the table. The table is empty. The plan step is to place all peppers on the table. The agent hasn't placed any yet. The last action was moving to table, no progress. The plan still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The question says: Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation. The last action was moving to table, no progress. The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed peppers yet. But the plan is still promising because the agent still has to place them. But the last action didn't modify state. But the plan is still promising? The question: "Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation." The last action was a move to table, no progress. But the plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed peppers yet. The plan is still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't done that yet. The plan is still promising? The plan is still promising because the agent still has to place peppers. But the last action didn't modify state. But the plan is still promising? The question: "Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation." The last action was a move to table, no progress. But the plan is still promising? The plan is to place all peppers on table. The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't made progress. But the plan is still promising? The plan is still promising? The agent hasn't placed them yet. The plan is still promising? The question: "Is the plan still promising?" The answer: no, because the last action produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step. So answer no.No – the last move to the table did not change the state or advance the goal of placing peppers on the table, so the plan is no longer promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

**Rationale**

* The human starts at (3.5, 1.0) with pepper 1 already in reach, so the first pick is free of movement.
* Collecting the remaining two peppers requires two additional moves (to (3.5, 1.5) and then to (3.0, 1.5)), each followed by a pick‑up.
* After all peppers are in the inventory, a single move to the table (3.5, 0.5) suffices; the three place actions then deposit each pepper.
* This yields the minimal 9‑action sequence (3 picks + 3 moves + 3 places) and achieves the goal without any extraneous actions.

* The human starts at (3.5, 1.0) with pepper 1 already in reach, so the first pick is free of movement.
* Collecting the remaining two peppers requires two additional moves (to (3.5, 1.5) and then to (3.0, 1.5)), each followed by a pick‑up.
* After all peppers are in the inventory, a single move to the table (3.5, 0.5) suffices; the three place actions then deposit each pepper.
* This yields the minimal 9‑action sequence (3 picks + 3 moves + 3 places) and achieves the goal without any extraneous actions.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the tree is still missing the concrete actions for the “Place all of the peppers on the table” sub‑goal.  
While the collection part is fully broken down into moves and pick‑ups, the placement step has only a single node that says “Place all of the peppers on the table.” To execute, we need to decompose that into:

1. Move to the table (3.5, 0.5).  
2. Place Pepper 5.  
3. Place Pepper 3.  
4. Place Pepper 4.

Until that sub‑goal is expanded, the plan cannot be executed.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Plan‑tree refinement**

1. **Keep the collection sub‑tree unchanged**  
   - `[361] Pick up pepper at (3.5, 1.0)` (no move needed)  
   - `[362] Move to (3.5, 1.5)`  
   - `[363] Pick up pepper at (3.5, 1.5)`  
   - `[364] Move to (3.0, 1.5)`  
   - `[365] Pick up pepper at (3.0, 1.5)`

2. **Expand the “place all peppers on the table” node**  
   Replace node `[360] Place all of the peppers on the table` with the following sequence (order of placement is arbitrary):

   ```
   [360a] Move to (3.5, 0.5)          # move to the table
   [360b] Place pepper 5 on the table
   [360c] Place pepper 3 on the table
   [360d] Place pepper 4 on the table
   ```

   (If you prefer a different order, just swap the placement nodes; the total number of actions remains the same.)

**Resulting minimal action sequence**

1. Pick up pepper at (3.5, 1.0)  
2. Move to (3.5, 1.5)  
3. Pick up pepper at (3.5, 1.5)  
4. Move to (3.0, 1.5)

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped pepper_4 into table_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- Pepper 4 was removed from the human’s inventory and placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The human remains at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The table now contains Pepper 4.  
- Pepper 5 and Pepper 3 stay in the human’s inventory.  
- Pepper 4 is no longer on the floor.

**Current facts**

| Item | Location / State |
|------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Pepper 5 | inventory |
| Pepper 3 | inventory |
| Pepper 4 | table (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table | contains Pepper 4 |

**Assumptions made**

1. Dropping the held pepper would place it on the table.  
2. The human’s location does not change during the drop.  
3. The inventory is updated to remove the dropped pepper.

**Which assumptions held true / failed**

- **Held true**: Pepper 4 appeared on the table, the human stayed at the table location, and the inventory no longer contained Pepper 4.  
- **Failed**: None. All assumptions were correct.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Moving to (3.5, 1.5) will change the agent’s location and bring it closer to the remaining pepper, so the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Moving to (3.5, 1.5) will change the agent’s location and bring it closer to the remaining pepper, so the plan is still promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree only contains the single high‑level goal “Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.” It has not been broken down into the necessary sub‑goals or primitive actions (e.g., move to each pepper, pick it up, move to the table, place each pepper). Therefore the plan is not sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the tree still contains high‑level subgoals that need to be broken down into concrete actions before the agent can start executing.  

**Reasoning**

1. **Collect Pepper 4** – this is a goal, not an action. The agent must first *move* to (3.0, 1.5) and then *pick up* the pepper.  
2. **Place all peppers on the table** – this goal is still abstract. The agent must decide the order of placement and perform a *move* to the table followed by a *place* action for each pepper in its inventory.  

Until these subgoals are expanded into atomic actions (move, pick up, place), the plan tree is not ready for execution.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped pepper_3 into table_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- Pepper 3 is now on the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The human remains at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Pepper 3 is removed from the human’s inventory.  
- Pepper 5 and Pepper 4 stay in the inventory.  
- No peppers remain on the floor.

**Assumptions made**

1. Dropping the held pepper places it on the table.  
2. The human’s location does not change during the drop.  
3. The inventory is updated to remove the dropped pepper.

**Which assumptions held true / failed**

- **Held true**: All three assumptions were correct.  
- **Failed**: None.

The table currently holds pepper_4 and pepper_3, but pepper_5 remains in the human’s inventory and has not yet been placed on the table. Therefore the plan to place all peppers on the table is still incomplete.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No.  
The table currently holds pepper_4 and pepper_3, but pepper_5 remains in the human’s inventory and has not yet been placed on the table. Therefore the plan to place all peppers on the table is still incomplete.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan is still promising. The recent actions have moved the agent from the floor to the table and successfully placed pepper_4 and pepper_3 on the table, leaving only pepper_5 in the inventory. This is clear progress toward the goal of having all peppers on the table.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes – the plan is still promising. The recent actions have moved the agent from the floor to the table and successfully placed pepper_4 and pepper_3 on the table, leaving only pepper_5 in the inventory. This is clear progress toward the goal of having all peppers on the table.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the plan tree is still at the top‑level goal only.  
To start execution we need to break it into concrete sub‑tasks (e.g., “move to pepper 1, pick it up”, “move to pepper 2, pick it up”, etc.) and then “move to the table and place each pepper”. Until those sub‑goals and their corresponding actions are added, the planner cannot generate an executable action sequence.

[decompose_imaginator] **Plan‑tree refinement**

1. **Prune** the three “collect + place” leaf nodes (371‑374).  
   *The goal requires that **all** peppers be collected first, then all be placed on the table, so we cannot intermix collect/​place actions.*

2. **Keep** the two higher‑level nodes  
   - **[375] Collect all peppers**  
   - **[376] Place all peppers on the table**  

3. **Decompose** each of those two nodes into the three individual pepper sub‑goals, preserving the required order:

```
[371] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table
  ├─ [375] Collect all peppers
  │    ├─ [377] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.0)
  │    ├─ [378] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5)
  │    └─ [379] Collect pepper at (3.0,1.5)

       ├─ [381] Place pepper at (3.5,1.5) on table
       └─ [382] Place pepper at (3.0,1.5) on table
```

4. **Ordering constraint**:  
   *All nodes under [375] must be completed before any node under [376] begins.*

                     to remove or merge tasks, mark_done(task_node_id) to label completed nodes
                     mark_focued(task_node_id) to set the next focus. Use only the provided plan editing tools to update the plan tree.
                    Update like this: **Plan‑tree refinement**

1. **Prune** the three “collect + place” leaf nodes (371‑374).  
   *The goal requires that **all** peppers be collected first, then all be placed on the table, so we cannot intermix collect/​place actions.*

2. **Keep** the two higher‑level nodes  
   - **[375] Collect all peppers**  
   - **[376] Place all peppers on the table**  

3. **Decompose** each of those two nodes into the three individual pepper sub‑goals, preserving the required order:

```
[371] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table
  ├─ [375] Collect all peppers
  │    ├─ [377] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.0)
  │    ├─ [378] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5)
  │    └─ [379] Collect pepper at (3.0,1.5)
  └─ [376] Place all peppers on the table
       ├─ [380] Place pepper at (3.5,1.0) on table
       ├─ [381] Place pepper at (3.5,1.5) on table
       └─ [382] Place pepper at (3.0,1.5) on table
```

4. **Ordering constraint**:  
   *All nodes under [375] must be completed before any node under [376] begins.*

This concise decomposition satisfies the requirement “collect all peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table” while keeping the plan minimal and well‑structured.

Goal: Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
Plan tree:
- [371] Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table. (current focus)
  - [373] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5) and place on table
  - [374] Collect pepper at (3.0,1.5) and place on table
  - [375] Collect all peppers
  - [376] Place all peppers on the table
Available leaf tasks:
[373] Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5) and place on table
[374] Collect pepper at (3.0,1.5) and place on table
[375] Collect all peppers
[376] Place all peppers on the table
Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] 373 – Collect pepper at (3.5, 1.5) and place it on the table.  
This is the next required step: we still need to pick up the pepper at (3.5, 1.5) and immediately place it on the table, after which we can handle the remaining pepper and finally place all peppers.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - Table at (3.5, 0.5) already contains pepper_4 and pepper_3.  
- Your inventory holds pepper_5.  
- No peppers remain on the floor.

Plan:
Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5) and place on table
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Action**

- **Place** Pepper 5 on the table.

[user] Plan:
Collect pepper at (3.5,1.5) and place on table
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Place pepper_5 on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
