[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5), while the table is at (3.5, 0.5) and currently empty. The potato is at (0.5, 1.5), and the chest is closed at (2.0, 2.0). The cucumber is not on the table.

[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber is collected by the agent at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Table is empty and located at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
- The agent can move directly to the table (no obstacles).  
- The table is accessible and allows placing objects.  

**Validation:**  
- Assumption about collecting the cucumber was correct.  
- Assumption about table accessibility remains valid (no blocking objects).  

**Next Step:** Move to the table and drop the cucumber.
