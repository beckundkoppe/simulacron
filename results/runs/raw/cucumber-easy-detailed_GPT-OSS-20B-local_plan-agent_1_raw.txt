|--------|----------|--------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) | at cucumber |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. **Cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5).** – *Correct.*  
2. **Human is now at the cucumber location.** – *Correct.*  
3. **Human has the cucumber in hand.** – *Incorrect.*  
4. **Goal (“cucumber on the table”) is achieved.** – *Incorrect.*

**Summary**

The action only moved the human to the cucumber’s position; it did not pick up the cucumber or place it on the table. The only correct assumption was that the cucumber was at the specified coordinates. All other assumptions about possession and goal completion were wrong.
