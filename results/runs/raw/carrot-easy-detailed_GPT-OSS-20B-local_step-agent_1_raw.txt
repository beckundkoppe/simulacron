Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1.0,4.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human moved from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.0, 4.0).  
- The table at (1.0, 4.0) remains empty.  
- The carrot is still in the human’s inventory (it was never dropped).

**Assumptions made**

1. *Assumption*: Moving to the table’s coordinates automatically places the carrot on the table.  
   - **Result**: Wrong – the carrot was not moved from the inventory to the table.

2. *Assumption*: The table was empty and ready to receive an object.  
   - **Result**: Correct – the table was indeed empty.

**Conclusion**

The action sequence performed did not achieve the requested goal of placing the carrot on the table. The correct minimal action would have been a `drop carrot` at the table’s location.
