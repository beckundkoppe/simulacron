Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [0] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.

Reasoning: The plan is only a single high-level goal and lacks concrete primitive actions and substeps (e.g., move to the other room, open/unlock door if closed/locked, search the room, pick up the potato, navigate to the table, and place/drop the potato). You need those specific action steps before execution.
