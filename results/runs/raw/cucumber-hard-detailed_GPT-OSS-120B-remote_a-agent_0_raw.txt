[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- **Agent position:** now at (3.5, 1.5) – the exact location of **cucumber_3**.  
- **Inventory:** still empty (the move action does not automatically pick anything up).  
- **cucumber_3:** remains at (3.5, 1.5) and is not being held.  
- **table_4:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5) with an empty surface.  

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *Moving to an object’s coordinates places the agent exactly at that object.* – **proved right** (the agent is now at the cucumber’s location).  
2. *Moving does not alter the object’s state (it stays where it was).* – **proved right** (cucumber_3 is still on the floor).  
3. *Inventory is unaffected by a move action.* – **proved right** (still empty).  

No other changes occurred. The next steps will be to **pick up cucumber_3** and then **place it on table_4**.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (pick‑up cucumber_3)**  

- **Agent position:** (3.5, 1.5) – still standing where the cucumber was.  
- **Inventory:** now contains **cucumber_3**.  
- **cucumber_3:** no longer on the floor; it is being held (in inventory).  
- **table_4:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5) with an empty surface.  

**Assumptions that were made before the pick‑up**  

1. *Picking up an object removes it from its location on the floor.* – **proved right** (cucumber_3 is no longer on the floor).  
2. *The picked‑up object is added to the agent’s inventory.* – **proved right** (cucumber_3 now in inventory).  
3. *No other objects or the agent’s position are affected by the pick‑up.* – **proved right** (table_4 and agent location unchanged).  

**New assumptions for the upcoming placement**  

- Placing an inventory object onto a table will put it on the table’s surface and remove it from inventory. (Will be verified after the place action.)

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move to the table)**  

- **Agent position:** (3.5, 0.5) – now standing on the table’s location.  
- **Inventory:** still contains **cucumber_3** (the cucumber has not been placed yet).  
- **cucumber_3:** being held (in inventory), not on the floor or on the table.  
- **table_4:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5); its surface is still empty.  

**Assumptions about the new state**  

1. *Moving to a coordinate places the agent exactly at that coordinate (including on top of a table).* – **proved right** (agent is now at (3.5, 0.5)).  
2. *Moving does not automatically drop anything the agent is carrying.* – **proved right** (cucumber_3 remains in inventory).  
3. *The table’s state (surface contents) is unaffected by an agent simply standing on it.* – **proved right** (the surface stays empty).  

All prior assumptions that moving only changes position and leaves inventory untouched remain correct. No new contradictions appear.
