- Collecting pepper_5 worked (it is no longer in the room).  
- The table’s readiness to receive peppers holds (it remains empty).  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- The agent can efficiently collect and place all peppers without obstacles.

- **pepper_4** is now collected (carried by the agent).  
- **pepper_3** and **pepper_5** remain on the **table**.  
- The **table** now contains **pepper_3**, **pepper_5**, and **pepper_4** (assuming placement occurs).  

**Facts:**  
- Agent holds **pepper_4**.  
- **pepper_3** and **pepper_5** are on the **table**.  
- **pepper_4** was uncollected and is now collected.  
- The **table** is no longer empty (contains 3 peppers).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- **Agent carrying capacity**: Proven (can carry 1 pepper at a time).  
- **Table capacity**: Valid (holds 3 peppers).  
- **Efficiency**: Unproven, but likely true (no obstacles).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Agent’s carrying capacity (confirmed via prior actions).  
- Table’s readiness (confirmed with 3 peppers).  

**Unproven Assumption:**  
- Efficiency in collecting/placing all peppers (still untested).  

**Next Steps:**  
Place **pepper_4** on the table to complete the goal.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discovery:**  
- You are holding **pepper_4** (collected).  
- The **table** contains **pepper_3** and **pepper_5** (2 peppers).  
- The **table** is at (3.5,0.5); you are at (3.0,1.5).  
- No obstacles block movement to the table.  

**Relevant Action:** Move to the table and place **pepper_4** there.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
