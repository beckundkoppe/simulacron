[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to (3,1).  
- Collected key_7 (no impact on potato/diamond).  

**Facts:**  
- Diamond_5 remains on table_4.  
- No potato exists in the environment.

- Chest_12 (closed, locked) contains unknown item.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Assumed key_7 could unlock chest_12 (proven partial; key is now held).  
- Assumed chest_12 might contain potato (unverified, likely incorrect).  

**Correct State:**  
- Diamond_5 on table_4.  
- Potato absent (goal unmet).  
- Key_7 collected but no potato found.  

**Result:** Goal failed (no potato to place).

[ACTION FAILURE] table_4 is too far away to interact. Hint: Move closer to the object before interacting.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Moved through door_8** (incorrect step; table_4 is too far to interact).  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_9** is in inventory (collected from chest_12).  
- **Table_4** is at a distance; interaction requires proximity.  
- **Diamond_5** remains on table_4.  

**Assumptions:**  
- **Assumed table_4 was accessible** (proven **wrong**; distance prevents interaction).  
- **Assumed potato_9 could be dropped directly** (proven **partial**; proximity required).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- **Table_4 is too far** (goal blocked).  
- **Distance invalidates drop action** (must move closer).  

**Correct State:**  
- **Potato_9** in inventory.  
- **Table_4** requires proximity for interaction.  
- **Chest_12** is open, empty (potato_9 collected).  

**Result:** Goal blocked by distance. Next action: **Move to table_4** to enable dropping.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. **Move to table_4** (position (4,4) or nearby).  
2. **Drop potato_9 on table_4**.  

**Final Outcome:**  
Once at table_4, **drop potato_9** to fulfill the goal.

[observer] **Observation:**  
- **Potato_9** is in inventory (new discovery).  
- **Table_4** is at (0.0,4.0); current position is (4.0,4.0) (distance prevents interaction).  

**Relevance to Goal:**  
- **Potato_9** is available to place.  
- **Distance** blocks direct interaction with table_4.  

**Next Action:** Move to table_4 to drop potato_9.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to **table_4** (position (0,4)) to enable interaction.  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_9** is in inventory (collected from chest_12).  
- **Table_4** is now at the same position (0,4), allowing direct interaction.  
- **Diamond_5** remains on table_4.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Assumed **proximity to table_4** was required for dropping (proven **correct**).  
- Assumed **potato_9 could be placed on table_4** (proven **correct**).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- Assumed **distance blocked interaction** (proven **wrong**; movement resolved it).  

**Correct State:**  
- **Potato_9** in inventory.  
- **Table_4** is accessible for dropping.  
- **Diamond_5** remains on table_4.
