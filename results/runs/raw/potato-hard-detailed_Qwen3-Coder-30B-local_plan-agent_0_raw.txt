[observer] I observe a box at position (1.0,1.0) containing a diamond, a table at position (0.0,4.0) that is empty, a key at position (3.0,1.0), and a door at position (4.0,4.0) that is closed but unlocked.

No potato was observed in the current room. The goal requires finding a potato in "the other room" which is not visible in my current perception. I need to go through the door to access the other room.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**
- Moved to box_11 and collected diamond
- Moved to shelf_13 and observed locked chest  
- Moved to door_8 and went through unlocked door

**Facts:**
- Diamond is in inventory
- Chest is locked with unknown contents
- Door is open and unlocked
- Now in other room

**Assumptions:**
- **Proved right:** Door was accessible/unlocked, could move through it
- **Proved wrong:** Potato is in other room (still undetected)

**Current State:** In other room with diamond, potato still undetected.

[observer] **Observations:**
- Box at (0.0,0.0) is empty
- Door at (0.0,1.0) is open and unlocked
- Shelf at (0.0,2.0) has locked chest containing unknown contents

**Relevant for goal:** Door is open/unlocked (allows access to other room where potato should be). Chest is locked, cannot check contents. No potato observed.

**New discoveries:** None - all observations match previous perceptions.
