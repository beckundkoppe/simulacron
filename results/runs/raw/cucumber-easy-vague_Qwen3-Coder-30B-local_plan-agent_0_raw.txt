[observer] I observe a cucumber at position (3.5,1.5) and a table at position (3.5,0.5) that is currently empty.

The cucumber is located near the table, and the table has an empty contents count, meaning it currently holds nothing.

This is relevant for placing the cucumber on the table, which is my goal. The table is at (3.5,0.5) and the cucumber is at (3.5,1.5), so they are in the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates, making it possible to place the cucumber on the table.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to the cucumber at (3.5,1.5) and take it, then move to the table at (3.5,0.5) and place it there.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
