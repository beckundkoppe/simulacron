[observer] You are in the “main” room at (0.5, 0.5).  
Your inventory contains a carrot (id carrot_4).  
A table (id table_3) is located at (1.0, 4.0) and is currently empty.  

These facts are directly relevant for placing the carrot on the table.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1,4)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the executed action**

- **New facts**
  - You are now standing at position **(1.0, 4.0)** – the exact location of `table_3`.
  - Your inventory **still contains** `carrot_4`; it has **not been placed** yet.
  - `table_3` remains **empty** (no objects on it).

- **Assumptions that were made**
  1. *“I can move directly from (0.5, 0.5) to (1, 4) in one action.”* – **proved correct**; you are now at the table’s coordinates.
  2. *“The table is at (1, 4) and is reachable.”* – **proved correct**; the move succeeded and you are standing on the table’s tile.
  3. *“Moving does not automatically drop carried items.”* – **proved correct**; the carrot is still in your inventory.

No other state changes occurred. The next minimal action to achieve the goal is to **drop** the carrot onto `table_3`.
