Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1.0,4.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- The human is now at the table’s location: (1.0, 4.0).  
- The carrot remains in the human’s inventory.  
- The table is still empty (no carrot on it).  

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The human moved to the table. | **Correct** – the move action succeeded. |
| The carrot was placed on the table. | **Incorrect** – the action only moved the human; it did not drop the carrot. |

**Summary**

The performed action achieved the minimal requirement of moving the human to the table, but it did not accomplish the goal of placing the carrot on the table. The carrot is still in the inventory, and the table remains empty.
