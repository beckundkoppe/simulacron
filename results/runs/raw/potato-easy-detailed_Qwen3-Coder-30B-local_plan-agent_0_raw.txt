[reflector] **Actions performed:**
- Moved to door_6
- Went through door_6 into chamber

**Facts:**
- Successfully entered the other room through the door
- The door was closed but unlocked (as observed earlier)
- I am now in the "chamber" (other room)

**Assumptions:**
- The potato exists in the other room (required for the goal)
- The door leads to the room containing the potato

**Verification:**
- The assumption that the potato is in the other room proved **right** - I am now in that room
- The assumption about the door being unlocked proved **right** - I was able to go through it
- The assumption about the potato's location proved **right** - I am now in the room where it should be

**Next step:** Need to search for the potato in this room.

[observer] I observe a chest_9 on shelf_10 at position (0.0,0.0) that contains a potato_7. The chest is at my current location (0.0,0.0). 

The relevant discovery is that the chest contains the potato I need. I still need to open the chest to access it. The previous attempts to move to the chest and open it failed, so I need to try opening it directly.

[reflector] **Actions performed:** Moved to chest_9 at position (0.0,0.0)

**Effect:** Move action completed but had no effect on chest - it didn't open or change state

**Facts:**
- Chest_9 is at position (0.0,0.0)
- Chest_9 contains potato_7
- Moving to chest_9 doesn't open it

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
- "Moving to" the chest automatically opens/accesses it - WRONG
- "Collect" is the correct action - WRONG

**Current state:** Need to use "open" action directly on chest_9 to access the potato.
