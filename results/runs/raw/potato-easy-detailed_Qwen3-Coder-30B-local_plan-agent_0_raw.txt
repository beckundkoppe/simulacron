[observer] I observe a key at position (3.0,1.0) and a table at position (0.0,3.0) that is currently empty. 

The key might be relevant if it unlocks the door, but I don't see a potato in my current room. I need to go to the other room to find the potato first. The table is empty, so I can't place anything on it yet.

I don't see any potato in the main room. I need to check the other room for it.
