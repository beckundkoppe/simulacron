[observer] I observe three peppers in the main room:  
- **pepper_5** at (3.5,1.0)  
- **pepper_4** at (3.0,1.5)  
- **pepper_3** at (3.5,1.5)  

The table at (3.5,0.5) is empty and ready to receive the peppers. No other peppers are present.

[action_imaginator] Take pepper_5 from (3.5,1.0).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Pepper_5 is collected.  
- Agent is at (3.5,1).  
- Peppers_4 and 3 remain in their positions.  
- Table at (3.5,0.5) is empty.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Movement to collect peppers_4 and 3 is unobstructed.  
- Table accepts peppers without additional actions (e.g., no need to open/close).  
- Collecting and placing peppers is direct (no hidden steps).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Pepper_5 was successfully collected (confirmed by "collected pepper_5").  
- Table is ready to receive peppers (explicitly stated as "empty and ready").  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- No obstacles exist for moving to peppers_4/3.  
- No need to interact with other objects (e.g., doors, locks).  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Move to pepper_4 (3.0,1.5) → collect.  
2. Move to pepper_3 (3.5,1.5) → collect.  
3. Move to table (3.5,0.5) → place all peppers.
