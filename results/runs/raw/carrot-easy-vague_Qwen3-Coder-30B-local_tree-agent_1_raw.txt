Goal: Place the carrot on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [83] Place the carrot on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Looking at the goal "Place the carrot on the table", I need to check if this is ready for execution or needs further decomposition.

The plan "Place the carrot on the table" is already quite minimal and direct. It specifies:
- What object to move (carrot)
- What to do with it (place)
- Where to place it (on the table)

This appears to be a complete, executable action that doesn't require further decomposition into sub-actions. The agent can directly execute this by moving the carrot to the table's location.

Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. The action is atomic and complete as specified.

Goal: Place the carrot on the table.
Plan tree:
- [83] Place the carrot on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] The current focus is "Place the carrot on the table" which is a single, clear task that directly achieves the goal. There are no subtasks to break this down further into, and no other tasks need to be prioritized before this one. This is the final action needed to complete the goal.

Yes, the current focus is still the best leaf task to pursue next.

[83] Place the carrot on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I observe:
- I am holding a carrot (carrot_4)
- There is a table (table_3) at position (1.0, 4.0) that is currently empty
- The table is within reach for placing the carrot

This confirms my plan can proceed as the table is empty and accessible.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] put_down(carrot_4, table_3)

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
