[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human agent moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.0).  
- No objects were picked up or moved.

**Facts in the new state**

| Object | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Pepper 1 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Pepper 2 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 3 | (3.0, 1.5) |

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. Moving to (3.5, 1.0) places the human close enough to all peppers.  
2. From that location the human can pick up any pepper that is at the same coordinates.  
3. The table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is reachable from the new position.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- **Held**: The human is indeed at (3.5, 1.0); the table is still at (3.5, 0.5).  
- **Failed**: The assumption that simply moving to (3.5, 1.0) would automatically collect the peppers is wrong – the peppers are still on the floor.  
- **Unverified**: Whether the human can pick up peppers from (3.5, 1.0) remains to be tested.

- Pepper 5 is now in the human’s inventory; it is no longer on the floor.  
- The human remains at (3.5, 1.0).

2. The human’s inventory can hold the pepper.  
3. No other objects or state changes occur during the pick‑up.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.0, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or moved.  
- Pepper 2 remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Pepper 5 and Pepper 3 stay in the human’s inventory.  
- Table remains at (3.5, 0.5).

**Current facts**

| Object | Position / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human  | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Pepper 5 | in inventory |
| Pepper 3 | in inventory |
| Pepper 2 | (3.0, 1.5) |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can move to (3.0, 1.5) without obstruction.  
2. Moving does not alter the positions of other objects.  
3. The inventory remains unchanged during a simple move.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- **Held**: Human successfully reached (3.0, 1.5); Pepper 2 stayed on the floor; inventory unchanged.  
- **Failed**: None.  
- **Unverified**: Whether the human can pick up Pepper 2 from the new location in the next step.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- Human moved to (3.0, 1.5) and picked up the pepper that was at that location.  
- All three peppers (5, 3, 2) are now in the human’s inventory.  
- The table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is empty.

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can pick up a pepper that shares the same coordinates.  
2. The inventory can hold multiple peppers.  
3. Moving does not alter the positions of other objects.

**Which assumptions held / failed**

- **Held**: All three peppers were successfully collected; inventory now contains them; table unchanged.  
- **Failed**: None.  
- **Unverified**: Whether the peppers can be placed on the table in the next step.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- Human moved to (3.0, 1.5) and picked up Pepper 4.  
- Pepper 4 is no longer on the floor; it is now in the human’s inventory.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) still contains Pepper 5.  
- Inventory now holds Pepper 3, Pepper 2, Pepper 4 (Pepper 5 is on the table).  

**Current facts**  
| Object | Position / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human  | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Table  | (3.5, 0.5) – contains Pepper 5 |
| Pepper 5 | on table |
| Pepper 3 | in inventory |
| Pepper 2 | in inventory |
| Pepper 4 | in inventory |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. The human can pick up an item when standing on the same coordinates.  
2. The inventory can hold multiple items.  
3. Picking up an item removes it from the floor and adds it to the inventory.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Pepper 4 was successfully collected (assumption 1).  
- Inventory updated correctly (assumption 2).  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- The earlier claim that Pepper 2 remained in the inventory was incorrect; Pepper 2 is no longer present in the inventory.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human moved from (3.0, 1.5) to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- No objects were moved or altered.  
- The inventory (Pepper 3, Pepper 2, Pepper 4) and the table (still holding Pepper 5) remain unchanged.

**Current facts**

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. The human can move onto the table’s coordinates without obstruction.  
2. Moving does not affect the inventory or the table’s contents.  
3. The table remains empty until the human places items on it.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- 1: The human successfully reached the table.  
- 2: Inventory and table state stayed unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- None (the earlier claim that Pepper 2 was no longer in the inventory was incorrect; Pepper 2 is still present).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human moved to the table’s coordinates (3.5, 0.5) and dropped **pepper_3** onto **table_6**.  
- **pepper_3** is no longer in the inventory; it is now on the table.  
- The inventory still contains **pepper_4** (and **pepper_2** if it was still held).  
- **table_6** remains at (3.5, 0.5) and now holds **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- The human stays at (3.5, 0.5).

**Current facts**

| Object   | Position / State                     |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 0.5)                           |

| pepper_4 | in inventory (still held)            |
| pepper_2 | in inventory (still held)            |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human can drop an item onto a table when standing on the same coordinates.  
2. The table can hold multiple items.  
3. Dropping an item removes it from the inventory.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- 1: Pepper_3 was successfully placed on the table.  
- 2: The table accepted a second item.  
- 3: Inventory was updated correctly (pepper_3 removed).

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- None – all assumptions made for this step held true.
