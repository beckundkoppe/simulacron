Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal "Place a potato on the table" requires subtasks like locating the potato, picking it up, navigating to the table, and putting it down. Without these decomposed steps, the plan cannot be executed directly. 

**Answer:** No, the plan needs decomposition into subtasks (e.g., "Take potato from [location]", "Go to table", "Put potato on table").

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan:**  
1. Take the potato from its current location (assumed to be accessible).  
2. Place the potato on the table.  

**Decomposition:**  
- **Take the potato**: If the potato is not already in hand, the agent must pick it up.  
- **Place the potato on the table**: Move to the table and put it down.  

This sequence ensures the potato is transferred to the table efficiently. No pruning is needed, as both steps are necessary.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed. The steps "Take the potato from its current location" and "Place the potato on the table" directly address the goal, assuming the potato's location is accessible (as stated in the plan). No additional steps are required for navigation or object discovery, as the problem constraints imply the potato is already in the agent's reachable area. Execution can proceed with these two actions. 

**Answer:** Yes.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is **not sufficiently decomposed**. While moving to door_6 and opening it are valid steps, the plan assumes the potato is directly accessible after opening the door. However, the potato is in a **container behind door_6**, requiring an additional step to **open the container** before taking the potato. The plan tree lacks this critical subtask, making the "Take potato" action incomplete. 

**Answer:** No, the plan tree needs to include opening the container holding the potato after accessing door_6.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan:**

Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes, moving to door_6 is still the best next task. The potato is inaccessible until door_6 is opened, which requires proximity. Since the door is closed but unlocked, the immediate priority is to move to its location (4.0,4.0) to interact with it. No alternative paths exist to retrieve the potato, making this the critical first step. 

**Answer:** Yes, the current focus (moving to door_6) remains the optimal next action.

[observer] Observation: Door_6 is closed but unlocked. No potato is visible in the room or inventory. The table remains empty. The key_4 is present but irrelevant to opening door_6.  

New discovery: The door is now at the same coordinates as the agent (4.0,4.0), confirming proximity. The potato is likely behind door_6, as assumed. Next action: Open door_6.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan remains promising. The agent has moved to door_6's location and confirmed it is closed but unlocked. The potato is assumed to be behind the door, so the next critical step is to **open door_6** to verify its presence. Since the door is already unlocked, no further unlocking is needed. This action directly advances the goal by accessing the potato's presumed location. No redundant steps are being repeated, and progress is still on track. 

**Answer:** Yes.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not yet completed**. While the door is open and the potato is assumed to be accessible, the current perception does not explicitly confirm the potato's presence. The agent must **take the potato** from the revealed location (behind door_6) and **place it on the table** to fulfill the goal. The final step requires explicit action to transfer the potato, which has not been executed yet. 

**Reasoning**: The potato's visibility in perceptions is unresolved, and the plan's final action (taking and placing) remains pending. The door is open, but the potato must still be interacted with directly.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is **not yet completed**. While the door is open and the potato is assumed to be accessible, the current perception does not explicitly confirm the potato's presence. The agent must **take the potato** from the revealed location (behind door_6) and **place it on the table** to fulfill the goal. The final step requires explicit action to transfer the potato, which has not been executed yet. 

**Reasoning**: The potato's visibility in perceptions is unresolved, and the plan's final action (taking and placing) remains pending. The door is open, but the potato must still be interacted with directly.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The plan is not promising because recent actions (opening door_6) did not result in the potato becoming visible or accessible in the current perception. Despite the door being open, the potato remains undetected, and no new state changes have occurred. The agent is stuck in a loop of checking the door's status without resolving the potato's location. The next step should be to explicitly take the potato (if it exists in the room) or investigate other areas.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Moved through door_6** into a new room ("chamber" or "main"), but the potato is not visible in the current perception.  

**Facts:**  
- Door_6 is open.  
- Potato was assumed to be behind door_6 but is now inaccessible in the new room.  
- Table_5 remains empty.  
- Key_4 is irrelevant.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Potato is in the new room (behind door_6) but not listed in perceptions.  
- Taking the potato from the new room will allow placement on the table.  

**Proven Right:**  
- Corrected assumption about needing to move to door_6.  
- Opening door_6 revealed the potato’s location (new room).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- Initial belief that potato was visible behind door_6 (it is not in current perception).  
- Potato is not directly accessible in the new room (requires further interaction).  

**Next Step:** Search the new room for the potato, take it, and place it on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**  
- The potato is inside **chest_9** on **shelf_10** at position (0.0,0.0).  
- The agent is currently at (0.0,1.0), requiring movement to (0.0,0.0) to access the chest.  

**Next Action:** Move to (0.0,0.0) to take the potato from the chest.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not completed**. While the agent has moved to the chest's location (0.0,0.0) to access the potato, the next steps require:  
1. **Opening the chest** (if not already open) to retrieve the potato.  
2. **Taking the potato** from the chest.  
3. **Navigating to the table** (location unspecified in the current context) to place it.  

The current action only addresses the first step (moving to the chest), leaving the potato retrieval and placement on the table incomplete.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, the plan is still promising. The agent is now at (0.0,1.0), adjacent to chest_9 (0.0,0.0), and the potato is explicitly located inside the chest. The next action (moving to (0.0,0.0) to take the potato) directly addresses the goal, with no redundant steps. Progress is imminent.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes, the plan is still promising. The agent is now at (0.0,1.0), adjacent to chest_9 (0.0,0.0), and the potato is explicitly located inside the chest. The next action (moving to (0.0,0.0) to take the potato) directly addresses the goal, with no redundant steps. Progress is imminent.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Moved to (0.0,0.0)** to access **chest_9** containing the potato.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is at (0.0,0.0) (chest_9 location).  
- **Potato is inside chest_9** on **shelf_10**.  
- **Table_5 remains empty**.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Taking the potato from chest_9 will allow placement on the table.  
- Chest_9 is accessible without additional interaction (e.g., opening).  

**Proven Right:**  
- Corrected assumption about potato location (inside chest_9, not behind door_6).  
- Movement to (0.0,0.0) resolved potato accessibility.  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- Initial belief potato was visible behind door_6 (it was in an inaccessible chest).  
- Assumption chest_9 required no interaction (may need opening, but not specified).  

**Next Step:** Take the potato from chest_9 and place it on table_5.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not yet completed**. While the agent has located the potato inside **chest_9** and is positioned to interact with it, the explicit actions to **take the potato** and **place it on the table** have not been executed. The final step requires these two actions to fulfill the goal. 

**Reasoning:**  
- The potato is accessible in **chest_9** (no further interaction needed).  
- The agent must **pick up the potato** and **place it on table_5** to complete the task.  
- The last recorded action was moving to the chest's location, not the actual transfer.  

Thus, the plan remains pending execution of the final steps.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising. The agent has reached the chest's location (0.0,0.0) where the potato is located, and the next logical step is to take the potato from the chest. Since the potato is explicitly stated to be inside the chest and the agent is already at the correct position, there is no repetition of actions or stalemate. The critical next steps (taking the potato and placing it on the table) are now feasible.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Moved to (0.0,0.0)** (chest_9 location).  
- **Dropped potato_7 into shelf_10** (not on table_5).  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_7 is in shelf_10** (not on table_5).  
- **Table_5 remains empty** and accessible.  
- **Chest_9 is closed** (no interaction required).  

**Assumptions:**  
- **Placing potato_7 on table_5 is feasible** (proven wrong).  
- **Table_5 is at (0.0,1.0)** (assumed, but action executed at (0.0,0.0)).  

**Proven Right:**  
- **Potato_7 is in shelf_10** (confirmed by drop action).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- **Assumption that placing potato_7 on table_5 would succeed** (it was dropped into shelf_10 instead).  
- **Incorrect coordinate for table_5** (agent was at (0.0,0.0) when dropping).  

**Next Step:** Move to table_5’s location (e.g., (0.0,1.0)) and place the potato there.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**  
- **Table_5** is not explicitly listed in current perceptions but is referenced in the initial problem.  
- **Potato_7** is in inventory (collected from shelf_10).  
- **Agent is at (0.0,0.0)** (shelf_10 location).  
- **Door_6** is open at (0.0,1.0), suggesting nearby accessible space.  

**Relevant Facts:**  
- Must place potato_7 on **table_5** (empty, per initial problem).  
- **Table_5** likely exists in the same room but is not explicitly described in current perception.  
- **Agent needs to move to table_5’s location** to place the potato.  

**Plan:** Move to table_5’s location (e.g., near door_6 at (0.0,1.0)) and place the potato there.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not yet completed**. The agent has moved to the chest's location (0.0,0.0) and collected the potato, but the previous attempt to place it on table_5 failed due to incorrect positioning. The next required step is moving to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) to place the potato there. Since this movement hasn't been executed yet, the plan remains incomplete. 

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed because the agent needs to move to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) to place the potato.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is **not yet completed**. The agent has moved to the chest's location (0.0,0.0) and collected the potato, but the previous attempt to place it on table_5 failed due to incorrect positioning. The next required step is moving to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) to place the potato there. Since this movement hasn't been executed yet, the plan remains incomplete. 

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed because the agent needs to move to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) to place the potato.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No, the plan is not promising. The agent previously dropped the potato into shelf_10, losing access to it in the inventory. Moving to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) without retrieving the potato from shelf_10 won't resolve the issue. The potato remains in shelf_10, and the agent must first pick it up again to place it on the table. This creates a loop of failed actions without progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No, the plan is not promising. The agent previously dropped the potato into shelf_10, losing access to it in the inventory. Moving to table_5's location (0.0,1.0) without retrieving the potato from shelf_10 won't resolve the issue. The potato remains in shelf_10, and the agent must first pick it up again to place it on the table. This creates a loop of failed actions without progress.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer:**  
Yes, the plan is sufficiently decomposed. The agent must first move to the table's location (e.g., (0.0,1.0)) to place the potato there. The next action is to **move to table_5’s coordinates** and then **place the potato on the table**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not yet completed**. While the potato is in inventory and the table's coordinates are known, the agent has not yet moved to **(0.0,3.0)** to place the potato. The final action requires explicit movement to the table's location followed by placement, which hasn't been executed in the provided steps. 

**Reasoning**: The latest observation confirms the agent is at (4.0,4.0), not at the table's (0.0,3.0) location. The plan hinges on moving to the table's coordinates first, which remains unaccomplished. Thus, the task is pending. 

**Answer**: No, the plan is not completed. The agent must move to (0.0,3.0) to place the potato on the table.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising. The agent needs to move to table_5's explicit coordinate (0.0,3.0) to place the potato, which hasn't been attempted yet. Previous failures occurred due to incorrect coordinates (e.g., (0.0,1.0)), but the current plan correctly targets the stated location. Since the potato is in inventory and the agent is at (4.0,4.0), moving to (0.0,3.0) is the next logical step. No progress has been made toward this goal yet, so the plan remains valid. 

**Answer:** Yes.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The plan is still promising. The agent needs to move to table_5's explicit coordinate (0.0,3.0) to place the potato, which hasn't been attempted yet. Previous failures occurred due to incorrect coordinates (e.g., (0.0,1.0)), but the current plan correctly targets the stated location. Since the potato is in inventory and the agent is at (4.0,4.0), moving to (0.0,3.0) is the next logical step. No progress has been made toward this goal yet, so the plan remains valid. 

**Answer:** Yes.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

content='**Answer:** Yes.  \n**Rationale:** The plan remains promising because the agent now knows the exact coordinate of table_5 (0.0,3.0) and the potato is in inventory.

Current plan tree:
- [771] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed. The final action requires moving to **table_5’s coordinates (0.0,3.0)** and placing the potato there. Since the potato is already in inventory and the table’s location is explicitly known, the minimal action sequence is:  
1. **Move to (0.0,3.0)** (table_5’s location).  
2. **Place potato_7 on table_5**.  

This directly achieves the goal without unnecessary steps. ✅

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Plan tree:
- [771] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] The current focus of placing the potato on the table is valid, but the agent must first move to the table's coordinates (0.0,3.0) to execute the placement. Since the potato is in inventory and the table is empty/accessible, the minimal action sequence is: **Move to (0.0,3.0) → Place potato_7 on table_5**. This directly achieves the goal without unnecessary steps. 

**Answer:** Yes, the current focus is correct. Move to (0.0,3.0) and place the potato on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**  
- **Table_5** is explicitly at **(0.0,3.0)** (critical for placement).  
- **Potato_7** is already in **inventory** (no need to search).  
- **Agent is at (4.0,4.0)**, requiring movement to **(0.0,3.0)** to place the potato.  

**Relevant Fact:** Direct placement possible once at table_5’s coordinates.

Plan:
Place a potato on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Move to (0.0,3.0) and place the potato on the table.

[user] Plan:
Place a potato on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to (0.0,3.0) to place the potato on table_5.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
