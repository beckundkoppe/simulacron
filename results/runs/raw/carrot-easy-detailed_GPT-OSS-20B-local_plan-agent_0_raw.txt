Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1.0,4.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human agent moved from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.0, 4.0).  
- The carrot remains in the human’s inventory (it was never dropped).  
- The table at (1.0, 4.0) remains empty.

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The table was empty before the action. | **Correct** – the table was indeed empty. |
| Moving to the table would automatically place the carrot on it. | **Incorrect** – the action only moved the human; the carrot was not dropped. |

**Summary**

The action achieved the minimal movement to the table but failed to place the carrot, leaving the goal unmet.
