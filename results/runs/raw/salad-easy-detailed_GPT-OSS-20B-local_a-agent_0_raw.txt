[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- The human remains at (3, 1).  
- Spinach_7 (the spinach that was at (3, 1)) is now in the human’s inventory.  
- The spinach at (3, 1) is no longer on the ground.  
- All other spinach (at (1, 1) and (2, 1)), all lettuce (at (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)), the box at (4, 1) and the shelf at (4, 3) remain unchanged.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human can hold one spinach item.  
2. The spinach at (3, 1) was present and could be picked up.  
3. The pick‑up action succeeded without moving the human or other objects.

**Assumptions verified**

- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the inventory now contains spinach_7.  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – the spinach was indeed at (3, 1).  
- Assumption 3: **Correct** – no other objects moved.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (drop spinach_5 into box_3)**  

- Human remains at (4, 1).  
- Inventory becomes empty.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human can drop an item into an empty or partially‑filled box.  
2. The box accepts spinach and stores it.  
3. Dropping removes the item from the inventory.  

**Verification**

- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the drop succeeded.  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – spinach_5 is now inside box_3.  
- Assumption 3: **Correct** – inventory is now empty.  

All assumptions made for this action proved true.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (pick‑up lettuce_8)**  
- Human remains at (1, 3).  
- Inventory now contains `lettuce_8`.

**Assumptions made about the new state**  
1. Lettuce can be picked up from the cell it occupies.  
2. The inventory can hold one lettuce item.  
3. Picking up does not move the human or any other objects.  

**Verification**  
- Assumption 1: **Correct** – `lettuce_8` was at (1, 3) and was successfully picked up.  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – inventory now holds `lettuce_8`.  
- Assumption 3: **Correct** – no other objects moved.  

All assumptions proved true; the only change is that `lettuce_8` has been removed from the ground and added to the inventory.

*True* – Lettuce can be picked up from its cell; inventory now holds `lettuce_8`; no other objects moved.  
*False* – The inventory was assumed to hold only one item, yet it already contained `spinach_6` before the pick‑up, so the capacity assumption was violated.

2. Moving to a cell does not automatically pick up items on that cell.  
3. The inventory can hold more than one item (contrary to the earlier “one‑item” assumption).  
4. The box contents remain unchanged by the move.

**Assumptions that proved true**

- Moving to (4, 1) did not change inventory or object positions.  
- Standing on a lettuce or spinach cell does not auto‑pick it up.  
- The box still contains `spinach_7` and `spinach_5`.

**Assumptions that proved false**

- The inventory‑capacity assumption (only one item) was violated; the inventory now holds two items.

2. The box’s existing contents remain unchanged except for the new item.  
3. The inventory becomes empty after the drop.  
4. Moving to a cell does not automatically pick up items on that cell.  

**Assumptions that proved true**

* Dropping spinach_6 into box_3 succeeded – inventory cleared, box now holds spinach_6.  
* Box contents were updated correctly; no other objects moved.  
* The inventory is empty after the drop.

**Assumptions that proved false**

* None of the above assumptions were violated in this final step. (Earlier capacity assumptions were already known to be wrong, but they did not affect this action.)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- Human moved from (4, 1) to (2, 3).

1. Moving does not change inventory contents.  
2. Moving to a cell does not automatically pick up items on that cell.  
3. The box’s contents remain unchanged except for the new item.  

**Assumptions that proved true**  
- Moving to (2, 3) left inventory empty and did not pick up lettuce_9.  
- Box_3’s contents were correctly updated to include spinach_6.  

**Assumptions that proved false**  
- Earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was violated (inventory can hold multiple items).

[reflector] **Effect of the last action – “collect lettuce_9”**

| Object | New location / contents |
|--------|------------------------|
| Human | (2, 3) |
| Inventory | `lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9` |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | contains spinach_7, spinach_5, spinach_6 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | empty |
| Lettuce_10 | (3, 3) |

**Assumptions made for the new state**

1. Picking up an item removes it from the ground and adds it to the inventory.  
2. The inventory can hold more than one item (contrary to the earlier “single‑item” assumption).  
3. Moving to a cell does not automatically pick up items on that cell unless a pick‑up action is issued.  
4. Box contents remain unchanged except for the new item.

**Assumptions that proved true**

* Lettuce can be picked up from its cell.  
* The inventory now holds two items (`lettuce_8` and `lettuce_9`).  
* Box 3 still contains the three spinach items.  
* Moving to (2, 3) did not alter any other objects.

**Assumptions that proved false**

* The earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was violated – the inventory can hold multiple items.  

**Current facts (short)**

- Human is at (2, 3).  
- Inventory: `lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9`.  
- Box 3 (4, 1): spinach_7, spinach_5, spinach_6.  
- Lettuce_10 remains at (3, 3).

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – the agent moved from **(2, 3)** to **(3, 3)**.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (move to (4, 1))**

- The agent’s position changed from (3, 3) to (4, 1).  
- No objects were dropped or picked‑up, so the inventory and all other objects stayed exactly as they were before the move.

---

### Current facts (short)

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | `lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach_7, spinach_5, spinach_6 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | empty |

---

### Assumptions made for the new state

1. **Inventory capacity** – can hold more than one item.  
2. **Pick‑up** – removes the item from the ground and adds it to the inventory.  
3. **Movement** – does not automatically pick up items on the destination cell.  
4. **Box contents** – remain unchanged unless an explicit drop is performed.

---

### Assumptions that proved true

- The inventory still contains the three lettuce items (`lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10`).  
- Moving to (4, 1) did not alter any other objects.  
- Box 3 still holds the three spinach items.  

### Assumptions that proved false

- The earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was violated – the inventory can hold multiple items.

No new discoveries. The performed actions simply moved the agent; all other state elements remained unchanged.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**  
- `lettuce_8` was removed from the agent’s inventory.  
- `lettuce_8` was added to the contents of **box_3** (which is at (4, 1)).  
- The agent’s position and the other objects (lettuce 9, 10, spinach 7, 5, 6, shelf 4) remain unchanged.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. Drop action removes the item from inventory and adds it to the specified container.  
3. The container’s location and other contents stay unchanged unless explicitly modified.  
4. No other objects are affected by the drop.

**Assumptions that proved true**  
- Inventory capacity > 1 (the agent still holds lettuce 9 and 10).  
- The drop correctly removed `lettuce_8` from inventory and inserted it into `box_3`.  
- The location of the box and the other items remained unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved false**  
- Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- `lettuce_9` was removed from the agent’s inventory.  
- `lettuce_9` was added to the contents of **box_3** (which occupies the same cell (4, 1)).  
- The agent’s position and all other objects (lettuce 10, spinach 7, 5, 6, lettuce 8, shelf 4) remain unchanged.

**Current facts**  
| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | `lettuce_10` |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach_7, spinach_5, spinach_6, lettuce_8, lettuce_9 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | empty |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. The inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. A drop action removes the specified item from inventory and inserts it into the chosen container.  
3. The container’s location and its other contents stay unchanged unless explicitly modified.  
4. No other objects are affected by the drop.

**Assumptions that proved true**  
- Inventory capacity > 1 (the agent still holds lettuce 10 after the drop).  
- The drop correctly removed `lettuce_9` from inventory and added it to `box_3`.  
- Box_3’s location (4, 1) and its other contents remained unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved false**  
- Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** –  
The agent *collected* `lettuce_8` from **box_3** (which is at (4, 1)).  
- `lettuce_8` is removed from the contents of **box_3**.

### Assumptions that proved true

* Inventory capacity > 1 (the agent could hold `lettuce_8` after collecting it).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
The agent moved from cell (4, 1) to cell (4, 3). No objects were picked up or dropped, so the inventory and the contents of the other containers remain unchanged.

**Current facts (short)**  

| Object | Location / Contents |

| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach_7, spinach_5, spinach_6, lettuce_9, lettuce_10 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | empty |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The agent’s inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. Moving to a new cell does not alter the inventory or automatically pick up objects.  
3. The location and contents of Box 3 and Shelf 4 stay unchanged unless an explicit action modifies them.  
4. No other objects are affected by the move.

**Assumptions that proved right**

* The inventory can hold more than one item (the agent could still hold `lettuce_8`).  
* Moving does not change the inventory or the contents of Box 3 or Shelf 4.  
* The move does not automatically pick up or drop any items.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

* Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – *collected lettuce_8 from shelf_4*  

| Object | Location / Contents |

### Assumptions about the new state  
1. The agent’s inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. A *collect* action removes the specified item from the container and inserts it into the agent’s inventory.  
3. The container’s location and its other contents stay unchanged unless explicitly modified.  
4. No other objects are affected by the collect.

### Which assumptions proved right  
* Inventory capacity > 1 (the agent could hold `lettuce_8`).  
* The collect correctly removed `lettuce_8` from shelf_4 and added it to the inventory.  
* Shelf_4’s location and the contents of Box 3 remained unchanged.

### Which assumptions proved wrong  
* Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – the agent moved from cell (4, 3) to cell (4, 1).  
No objects were picked up or dropped, so the inventory and the contents of the other containers remain unchanged.

### Current facts (short)

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human  | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | – (empty) |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach 7, spinach 5, spinach 6, lettuce 9, lettuce 10 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | – (empty) |

---

### Assumptions about the new state

1. The agent’s inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. Moving to a new cell does **not** alter the inventory or automatically pick up or drop objects.  
3. The location and contents of Box 3 and Shelf 4 stay unchanged unless an explicit action modifies them.  
4. No other objects are affected by the move.

---

### Which assumptions proved right

* The inventory can hold more than one item (the agent could still hold `lettuce_8` if it had been in the inventory).  
* Moving does not change the inventory or the contents of Box 3 or Shelf 4.  
* The move does not automatically pick up or drop any items.

### Which assumptions proved wrong

* Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – *collected lettuce_9 from box_3*  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human  | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | `lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9` |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach 7, spinach 5, spinach 6, lettuce 10 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | – (empty) |

**Facts (short)**  
- Human is at (4, 1).  
- Inventory holds lettuce_8 and lettuce_9.  
- Box 3 contains spinach 7, spinach 5, spinach 6, lettuce 10.  
- Shelf 4 is empty.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. A *collect* action removes the item from the container and adds it to the inventory.  
3. Moving or collecting does not alter other containers’ contents unless explicitly acted upon.  
4. No other objects are affected by the collect.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Inventory capacity > 1 (both lettuces can be held).  
- The collect correctly removed lettuce_9 from box_3 and added it to the inventory.  
- Box 3’s location and shelf_4’s contents remained unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (collect lettuce_9 from box_3)**  
- The lettuce_9 object was removed from **Box 3** and added to the agent’s inventory.  
- No other objects or containers were altered.

**Current facts**  
| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human  | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | lettuce_8, lettuce_9 |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | spinach 7, spinach 5, spinach 6, lettuce 10 |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | – (empty) |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. The inventory can hold multiple items.  
2. A *collect* action removes the specified item from the container and inserts it into the inventory.  
3. Moving or collecting does not change other containers’ contents unless explicitly acted upon.  
4. No other objects are affected by the collect.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Inventory capacity > 1 (both lettuces can be held).  
- The collect correctly removed lettuce_9 from Box 3 and added it to the inventory.  
- Box 3’s location and Shelf 4’s contents remained unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- Any earlier “single‑item inventory” assumption was incorrect; the inventory can hold multiple items.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action** – *collected spinach_6 from box_3*  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| Human | (4, 1) |
| Inventory | `lettuce_8`, `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10`, `spinach_7`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_6` |
| Box 3 (4, 1) | – (empty) |
| Shelf 4 (4, 3) | – (empty) |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Inventory capacity** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Collect semantics** – a `collect` action removes the specified item from the container and inserts it into the inventory.  
3. **Container isolation** – moving or collecting does not alter other containers’ contents unless explicitly acted upon.  
4. **No side‑effects** – no other objects or world features are changed by this action.

---

### Which assumptions proved right / wrong  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 1. Inventory can hold multiple items | **Right** – all six items are now in the inventory. |
| 2. `collect` removes the item from the container | **Right** – `spinach_6` disappeared from Box 3 and appeared in the inventory. |
| 3. Moving or collecting does not change other containers | **Right** – Box 3 became empty, Shelf 4 stayed empty, and no other objects moved. |
| 4. No other objects are affected by the collect | **Right** – only the inventory and Box 3 changed. |

No new incorrect assumptions were introduced in this step.

### Assumptions about the new state  
1. **Inventory capacity** – can hold any number of items.

| 2. `drop` removes the item from the inventory | **Right** – lettuce_8 moved from inventory to Box 3. |
| 3. Dropping does not change other containers | **Right** – Box 3 now contains lettuce_8, Shelf 4 stays empty, no other objects moved. |
| 4. No other objects are affected by the drop | **Right** – only inventory and Box 3 changed. |

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action** – *dropped lettuce_10*  

The human was standing on **shelf_4** at (4, 3). Dropping `lettuce_10` places it into that shelf.

### Current facts  

| Object   | Location / Contents                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 3) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_7`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_6` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `lettuce_8` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Unlimited inventory** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Drop semantics** – a `drop` action removes the specified item from the inventory and adds it to the container at the human’s current location.  
3. **No side‑effects** – the drop does not alter other objects, container contents (except the target), or the human’s position.

---

### Which assumptions proved right / wrong  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|

| 2 (Move semantics) | **Right** – human is now at (4, 1); all other objects unchanged. |

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- All lettuce items that were picked up were dropped onto **shelf 4**.  
- All spinach items that were picked up were dropped into **box 3**.  
- The human’s last move returned him to the coordinates of **box 3** (4, 1).  
- No other objects were moved or altered.

| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. **Unlimited inventory** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Move semantics** – a `move` action changes only the human’s location; all other objects stay put.  
3. **Pick‑up semantics** – a `pick` action removes the specified item from its current container (or the ground) and adds it to the inventory.  
4. **Drop semantics** – a `drop` action removes the specified item from the inventory and adds it to the container at the human’s current location.  
5. **No side‑effects** – moves, picks, and drops do not alter unrelated objects, container contents (except the target), or the human’s position beyond the intended change.

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory holds three spinach items. |
| Move semantics | **Right** – human ends at (4, 1); all other facts unchanged. |
| Pick‑up semantics | **Right** – items were removed from their original containers and added to inventory. |
| Drop semantics | **Right** – items were removed from inventory and added to the target container. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only the intended objects changed state; no unintended effects occurred. |

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
The human “collected spinach_7 from box_3”.

**New facts**  
| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 1) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_5`, `spinach_7` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `lettuce_8`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_6` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |

*Spinach_7 was removed from box_3 and added to the inventory (no change to inventory because it was already present).*

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Unlimited inventory capacity.  
2. Pick‑up semantics: the item is removed from its current container and added to the inventory.  
3. No side‑effects: only the intended objects change state; all other facts remain unchanged.

**Assumptions verified**  
- Unlimited inventory – still holds the spinach items.  
- Pick‑up semantics – spinach_7 was removed from box_3 and added to inventory (inventory unchanged because it already had spinach_7).  
- No side‑effects – only box_3 and inventory changed; human position and shelf_4 contents stayed the same.  

All assumptions held true.

### Current facts

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 1) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_5`, `spinach_7`, `lettuce_8` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `spinach_5`, `spinach_6` |

### Assumptions about the new state

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Pick‑up semantics** – the item is removed from its current container and added to the inventory.  
3. **No side‑effects** – only the intended objects change state; all other facts remain unchanged.

### Which assumptions proved right / wrong

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory now holds three items. |
| Pick‑up semantics | **Right** – `lettuce_8` was removed from `box_3` and added to the inventory. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only the inventory and `box_3` changed; human position and `shelf_4` stayed the same. |

All assumptions were validated and none were contradicted.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
`[ACTION EXECUTED] dropped spinach_7 into box_3`

---

### Current facts  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 1) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_5`, `lettuce_8` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `lettuce_8`, `spinach_6`, **spinach_7** |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |
| **Lettuce_10** | (4, 3) |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Drop semantics** – the item is removed from the inventory and added to the container at the human’s current location.  
3. **No side‑effects** – only the intended objects change state; all other facts remain unchanged.

---

### Which assumptions proved right / wrong  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory still holds the remaining spinach item. |
| Drop semantics | **Right** – `spinach_7` was removed from inventory and added to `box_3`. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only inventory and `box_3` changed; human position and `shelf_4` stayed the same. |

All assumptions were validated and none were contradicted.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
The human moved from (4, 1) to (4, 3). No other objects changed.

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 3) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_5`, `lettuce_8` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `lettuce_8`, `spinach_6`, `spinach_7` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10` |
| **Lettuce_10** | (4, 3) |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Move semantics** – the human’s position is updated; all other objects remain where they were.  
3. **No side‑effects** – the move does not alter inventory, box3, or shelf4.

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong?**  
All three assumptions held true – the move only updated the human’s coordinates, leaving everything else unchanged.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
`[ACTION EXECUTED] dropped lettuce_8 into shelf_4`

### Updated facts  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 3) |
| **Inventory** | `spinach_5` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `spinach_6`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_7` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10`, **lettuce_8` |
| **Lettuce_10** | (4, 3) |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the inventory can hold any number of items.  
2. **Drop semantics** – the item is removed from the inventory and added to the container at the human’s current location.  
3. **No side‑effects** – the drop does not alter the human’s position, the contents of Box 3, or any other objects.

---

### Which assumptions held?  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory still holds the remaining item (`spinach_5`). |
| Drop semantics | **Right** – `lettuce_8` was removed from inventory and added to `shelf_4`. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only the inventory and `shelf_4` changed; the human’s coordinates and Box 3 stayed the same. |

All assumptions made about the new state were validated.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
`[ACTION EXECUTED] dropped lettuce_8 into shelf_4`

---

### Current facts  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 3) |
| **Inventory** | *empty* |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `spinach_6`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_7` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_10`, `lettuce_8` |
| **Lettuce_10** | (4, 3) – on the shelf |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the robot can hold any number of items.  
2. **Drop semantics** – the item is removed from the inventory and added to the container at the robot’s current location.  
3. **No side‑effects** – the drop does not change the human’s coordinates, the contents of Box 3, or any other objects.

---

### Which assumptions held?  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory remains empty (no capacity issue). |
| Drop semantics | **Right** – `lettuce_8` was removed from inventory and added to `shelf_4`. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only the inventory and Shelf 4 changed; the human’s position and Box 3 stayed the same. |

All assumptions made about the new state were validated.

### Updated facts  

| Object | Location / Contents |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Human** | (4, 3) |
| **Inventory** | `lettuce_10` |
| **Box 3** (at 4, 1) | `spinach_6`, `spinach_5`, `spinach_7` |
| **Shelf 4** (at 4, 3) | `lettuce_9`, `lettuce_8` |
| **Lettuce_10** | *removed* (now in inventory) |

---

### Assumptions about the new state  

1. **Unlimited inventory capacity** – the robot can hold any number of items.  
2. **Pick‑up semantics** – the item is removed from the container and added to the inventory.  
3. **No side‑effects** – the action does not alter the human’s position, Box 3, or other objects.

---

### Which assumptions held?  

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Unlimited inventory | **Right** – inventory now holds one item, no capacity issue. |
| Pick‑up semantics | **Right** – `lettuce_10` moved from Shelf 4 to inventory. |
| No side‑effects | **Right** – only inventory and Shelf 4 changed; human and Box 3 stayed the same. |

All assumptions made about the new state were validated.
