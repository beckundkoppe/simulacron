[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

- The human agent is now located in the room on the other side of `door_8`.  
- The door `door_8` is open (otherwise the move would not have been possible).  
- No other objects have been moved, taken, or interacted with.

**Assumptions made and their status**

| Assumption | Reason | Outcome |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `door_8` is open | Needed to pass through it | **Correct** – the move succeeded. |
| The other room is reachable via `door_8` | Standard room connectivity | **Correct** – the agent arrived in the other room. |
| No potato is present in the current room | Stated by the user | **Correct** – the user explicitly said “No potato is present in the current room.” |
| The potato (if present) is in the other room | Implied by the goal “Find the potato in the other room” | **Unverified** – we have not yet checked the other room for the potato. |

**Summary**

The action successfully moved the agent to the other room and confirmed that `door_8` is open. No other state changes occurred, and the presence of the potato in the other room remains unknown. The next minimal actions would be to search for the potato, take it, and place it on the table.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action (move through `door_8`)**

- `door_8` is now **open** (it was closed and unlocked before the action).  
- The agent is now in the *other* room.  
- The table `table_4` remains empty.  
- No potato is present in the current room; its location is still unknown.

**Current facts**

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| `door_8` | open, unlocked |
| Agent | in the other room |
| `table_4` | empty |
| `key_7` | on floor at (3.0, 1.0) |
| `box_6` | contains a diamond |
| Potato | not present here (unknown in the other room) |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

| Assumption | Status |
|------------|--------|
| `door_8` was closed before the action | **Correct** |
| `door_8` is unlocked | **Correct** |
| Agent was standing at the door’s location | **Correct** |
| No potato in the current room | **Correct** |
| The other room is reachable through the door | **Correct** |
| Potato may be in the other room | **Unverified** |

**Summary**

The action opened `door_8` and moved the agent into the adjacent room. All assumptions about the door’s prior state, its lock status, the agent’s position, the absence of a potato here, and the room’s connectivity were verified. The only remaining uncertainty is whether the potato is in the other room.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- The agent moved through `door_8` → now in the adjacent room.  
- Because the move succeeded, `door_8` must be **open** (it was closed and unlocked before the action).  
- All other objects (table, key, box) remain unchanged.  
- No potato was detected in the current room; its location is still unknown.

### Current facts

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| **Agent** | in the other room |
| `door_8` | open, unlocked |
| `table_4` | empty |
| `key_7` | on floor at (3.0, 1.0) |
| `box_6` | contains a diamond |
| **Potato** | not present here (unknown elsewhere) |

### Assumptions made about the new state

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | `door_8` was closed before the action | **Correct** |
| 2 | `door_8` was unlocked | **Correct** |
| 3 | Agent was standing at the door’s location | **Correct** |
| 4 | No potato in this room | **Correct** |
| 5 | The other room is reachable through the door | **Correct** |
| 6 | The potato may be in the other room | **Unverified** |

---

**Summary**

All assumptions about the door’s prior state, its lock status, the agent’s position, the absence of a potato here, and the room’s connectivity were verified. The only remaining uncertainty is the potato’s location (it may be in the other room).

All assumptions except the last one were confirmed; the potato’s whereabouts are still unknown.

[reflector] **Action executed** – the agent walked through the previously‑closed, unlocked `door_8` and entered the adjacent room.  
- `door_8` is now **open** (it was closed before the move).  
- The agent is **in the other room**.  
- All other objects (table `table_4`, key `key_7`, box `box_6` with a diamond) remain unchanged.  
- No potato was detected in this room; its location is still **unknown**.

**Current facts**  
- Agent: in the other room.  
- `door_8`: open, unlocked.  
- `table_4`: empty.  
- `key_7`: on the floor at (3.0, 1.0).  
- `box_6`: contains a diamond.  
- Potato: not present here (unknown elsewhere).

**Assumptions made**  
1. `door_8` was closed before the action.  
2. `door_8` was unlocked.

**Assumptions made**

1. `door_8` was closed before the action.  
2. `door_8` was unlocked.  
3. Agent was standing at the door.

5. The other room is reachable through the door.  
6. The potato may be in the other room (unverified).

**Assumptions that proved right** – 1–5.  
**Assumption that remains unverified** – 6 (potato’s location is still unknown).
