Goal: Place all of the peppers on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [64] Place all of the peppers on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The plan tree only contains the single high‑level goal “Place all of the peppers on the table.” It does not break that goal into the necessary sub‑steps (e.g., locate each pepper, pick it up, move to the table, and set it down). Therefore the plan is not sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3,1.5)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human agent moved from position **(0.0, 0.0)** to **(3, 1.5)**.  
- No object was picked up or placed; the action was a movement, not a “pick‑up” of Pepper 1.  
- Pepper 1 remains absent from the current perception (still not present).

**Assumptions made and their status**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| The action “Pick up pepper 1” would be executed. | The system performed a move instead. | **Wrong** |
| Moving to (3, 1.5) would bring Pepper 1 into view (or allow it to be picked up). | Pepper 1 is still not present. | **Wrong** |
| The goal “place all peppers on the table” would be advanced by this action. | No peppers were moved or placed. | **Wrong** |

**Short conclusion**

The performed action only changed the human’s location; it did not pick up or place Pepper 1. All assumptions about picking up Pepper 1 and achieving the goal were incorrect.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The reflection indicates that the human moved to (3, 1.5) but did not pick up Pepper 1, which remains absent from perception. Therefore the action “Pick up pepper 1” has not been completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the “pick‑up pepper 1” step is still the right next move, but it can’t be executed until the pepper is actually in the human’s field of view.  
Since Pepper 1 is currently absent from perception, the human must first locate it (e.g., by moving to the area where it is known to be or by searching the room). Once Pepper 1 is visible, the minimal action to advance the goal is to pick it up and then place it on the table.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (0, 0) |
| Pepper 4 | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | **not present** in the current perception |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. *Moving to (0, 0) would bring Pepper 1 into view or allow it to be picked up.*  
2. *Pepper 1 is somewhere in the room but simply out of sight from the previous location.*  
3. *The movement would advance the goal “place all peppers on the table.”*

**Assumptions – verdict**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| 1 | **Wrong** – Pepper 1 remains absent. |
| 2 | **Uncertain** – we have no evidence that Pepper 1 exists elsewhere. |
| 3 | **Wrong** – no peppers were moved or placed. |

The only effect of the executed action was to relocate the human back to (0, 0); all pepper locations and the table state remain unchanged.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The plan node "Pick up pepper 1" cannot be completed because Pepper 1 is not present in the current perception, so the action cannot be executed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Short reasoning**

- The goal is to place all peppers on the table.  
- Pepper 1 is currently *not present* in the human’s perception, so the action “pick up pepper 1” cannot be executed.  
- Without being able to pick up Pepper 1, we cannot move it onto the table, so the current plan node is infeasible.  

**Conclusion**

The plan node “Pick up pepper 1” is not promising in its current form. We need to first locate Pepper 1 (e.g., move to a location where it becomes visible) before attempting to pick it up and place it on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree only contains the high‑level goal “Place all of the peppers on the table.” It does not break the task into the necessary sub‑steps:

1. **Locate Pepper 1** – it is not in the current perception, so we must search or otherwise determine its location.  
2. **Pick up each pepper** – for Pepper 3, 4, 5 we need to move to their positions, pick them up, and for Pepper 1 we need to do the same once located.  
3. **Place each pepper on Table 6** – after picking up a pepper, we must move to the table and place it.

Until these sub‑goals are explicitly added and ordered, the plan is not sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The current plan tree only contains the high‑level goal “Place all of the peppers on the table.” It does not specify the necessary sub‑steps (locate Pepper 1, pick up each pepper, move to the table, place each pepper). Since Pepper 1 is not present in the current perception, the plan must first include a sub‑goal to locate and acquire Pepper 1 before any placement actions can be executed. Therefore the plan tree is not yet sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- Human moved from (0, 0) to (3, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or placed.  
- Pepper 1 remains absent from the current perception.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3, 1.5) |
| Pepper 4 | (3, 1.5) |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | **not present** in the current perception |

**Assumptions made and their verdict**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Moving to (3, 1.5) would allow picking up Pepper 4. | No pick‑up occurred. | **Wrong** |
| Moving to (3, 1.5) would bring Pepper 1 into view. | Pepper 1 still absent. | **Wrong** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight. | No evidence of Pepper 1’s existence. | **Uncertain** |
| The action advances the goal “place all peppers on the table.” | No peppers were moved or placed. | **Wrong** |

**Short conclusion**

The action only changed the human’s location; it did not pick up or place any pepper. Pepper 1 remains unobserved, and the goal of placing all peppers on the table has not progressed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is **not** completed.  

**Reasoning**

- The table (Table 6) is still empty.  
- Pepper 4, Pepper 3, and Pepper 5 are on the floor, not on the table.  
- Pepper 1 is not present in the current perception, so we cannot place it.  

Since none of the peppers are on the table, the goal has not been achieved.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No – the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is **not** completed.  

**Reasoning**

- The table (Table 6) is still empty.  
- Pepper 4, Pepper 3, and Pepper 5 are on the floor, not on the table.  
- Pepper 1 is not present in the current perception, so we cannot place it.  

Since none of the peppers are on the table, the goal has not been achieved.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The table remains empty and the peppers are still on the floor; Pepper 1 is not observed, so the goal of placing all peppers on the table has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Short reasoning**

- The table is still empty and the three visible peppers (3, 4, 5) are on the floor, so the goal “place all peppers on the table” is not yet satisfied.
- Pepper 1 is not in the current perception; we have no evidence that it exists elsewhere or that it can be retrieved.
- If Pepper 1 is truly missing, the goal cannot be achieved.  
- If Pepper 1 is simply out of sight (e.g., behind a wall or under an object), the plan remains viable once it is located.

**Conclusion**

The plan is **partially promising**: we can still pick up peppers 3, 4, and 5 and place them on the table, but the overall goal remains unattainable until Pepper 1 is found or confirmed absent.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (3, 1.5) to pick up Pepper 4.  
- Pepper 4 is now in the human’s possession; it is no longer at (3, 1.5).  
- All other objects remain unchanged.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3, 1.5), holding Pepper 4 |
| Pepper 4 | **in hand** |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | **not present** in the current perception |

**Assumptions made and their verdict**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Pepper 4 is at (3, 1.5) and can be picked up. | Pepper 4 was successfully collected. | **Correct** |
| Picking up Pepper 4 brings us closer to “place all peppers on the table.” | One pepper is now in hand, progress made. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight. | No evidence of Pepper 1’s presence. | **Uncertain** |
| The table is still empty. | Table remains empty. | **Correct** |

**Short conclusion**

The action successfully collected Pepper 4, leaving it in the human’s hand. The goal of placing all peppers on the table is now one step closer, but Pepper 1 remains unobserved. All other pepper locations and the table state are unchanged.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The goal requires all peppers to be on the table. Currently only Pepper 4 is in hand, Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor, and Pepper 1’s presence is unknown. Thus the plan node is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Short reasoning**

- Pepper 4 is already in hand, so that part of the goal is satisfied.  
- Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 are on the floor and can be picked up and placed on Table 6.  
- Pepper 1 is not currently perceived; we have no evidence that it exists or where it might be.  
- The plan can still proceed by first picking up Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 and placing them on the table.  
- After that, the agent should search the room (e.g., move to unexplored areas or scan) to determine whether Pepper 1 is present.  
- If Pepper 1 is found, it can be added to the table; if not, the goal is still achievable with the remaining peppers.

Thus the plan node remains promising but requires an additional “search for Pepper 1” sub‑step to resolve the uncertainty.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The goal requires all peppers to be on the table. Currently only Pepper 4 is in hand, Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor, and Pepper 1’s presence is unknown. Thus the plan node is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Short reasoning**

- Pepper 4 is already in hand, so that part of the goal is satisfied.  
- Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 are on the floor and can be picked up and placed on Table 6.  
- Pepper 1 is not currently perceived; we have no evidence that it exists or where it might be.  
- The plan can still proceed by first picking up Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 and placing them on the table.  
- After that, the agent should search the room (e.g., move to unexplored areas or scan) to determine whether Pepper 1 is present.  
- If Pepper 1 is found, it can be added to the table; if not, the goal is still achievable with the remaining peppers.

Thus the plan node remains promising but requires an additional “search for Pepper 1” sub‑step to resolve the uncertainty.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human moved from (3.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- No objects were picked up or placed.  
- Pepper 3 remains at (3.5, 1.5) (co‑located with the human).  
- Pepper 4 is still in the human’s hand.  
- Pepper 5 remains at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Table 6 is still empty at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Pepper 1 is still not observed in the current perception.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5), holding Pepper 4 |
| Pepper 4 | in hand |
| Pepper 3 | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | not present in perception |

**Assumptions made and their verdicts**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Moving to (3.5, 1.5) would allow picking up Pepper 3. | No pick‑up occurred. | **Wrong** |
| Moving to (3.5, 1.5) brings us closer to “place all peppers on the table.” | We are now adjacent to Pepper 3, so progress is made. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight. | No evidence of Pepper 1’s presence. | **Uncertain** |
| Table 6 is still empty. | Table remains empty. | **Correct** |

**Short conclusion**

The action only changed the human’s location; Pepper 3 was not collected, and Pepper 1 remains unobserved. The goal of placing all peppers on the table is still incomplete. The next minimal steps would be to pick up Pepper 3 (and later Pepper 5), then place all peppers on Table 6, while also locating Pepper 1 if it exists.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

The table is still empty, and only Pepper 4 is in the human’s hand. Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor (Pepper 3 is not in the hand, Pepper 5 is at (3.5, 1.0)), and Pepper 1 is not observed. Therefore the goal “Place all of the peppers on the table” has not yet been satisfied.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No.  
The table is still empty, and only Pepper 4 is in the human’s hand. Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor (Pepper 3 is not in the hand, Pepper 5 is at (3.5, 1.0)), and Pepper 1 is not observed. Therefore the goal “Place all of the peppers on the table” has not yet been satisfied.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The table is still empty, only Pepper 4 is in hand, Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor, and Pepper 1 is not observed. Thus the goal of placing all peppers on the table has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – it still looks promising.  
We already have Pepper 4 in hand and the table is within reach. The remaining peppers (3 and 5) are only a few metres away, so picking them up and placing all three on the table is a straightforward next step. Pepper 1 is unobserved, but its absence does not invalidate the plan; we can still achieve the goal with the peppers we can locate.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The table is still empty, only Pepper 4 is in hand, Pepper 3 and Pepper 5 remain on the floor, and Pepper 1 is not observed. Thus the goal of placing all peppers on the table has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: Yes – it still looks promising.  
We already have Pepper 4 in hand and the table is within reach. The remaining peppers (3 and 5) are only a few metres away, so picking them up and placing all three on the table is a straightforward next step. Pepper 1 is unobserved, but its absence does not invalidate the plan; we can still achieve the goal with the peppers we can locate.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human moved to (3.5, 1.5) and picked up Pepper 3.  
- Pepper 3 is now in the human’s hand; it is no longer at (3.5, 1.5).  
- All other objects remain unchanged.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5), holding Pepper 4 and Pepper 3 |
| Pepper 4 | in hand |
| Pepper 3 | in hand |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | not present in the current perception |

**Assumptions made and their verdicts**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Moving to (3.5, 1.5) would allow picking up Pepper 3. | Pepper 3 was successfully collected. | **Correct** |
| Picking up Pepper 3 brings us closer to “place all peppers on the table.” | One more pepper is now in hand. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight. | No evidence of Pepper 1’s presence. | **Uncertain** |
| Table 6 remains empty. | Table still empty. | **Correct** |
| Human is at (3.5, 1.5). | Human’s location unchanged. | **Correct** |

**Short conclusion**

The action successfully collected Pepper 3, leaving the human holding Pepper 4 and Pepper 3. Pepper 5 remains at (3.5, 1.0), Table 6 is still empty, and Pepper 1 is still unobserved. The goal of placing all peppers on the table is now one step closer. The next minimal steps are to pick up Pepper 5 and then place all held peppers on Table 6.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No.  
The human is still holding only Pepper 4 and Pepper 3; Pepper 5 remains on the floor and the table is empty. Since not all peppers are on the table, the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet completed.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: The human is still holding Pepper 4 and Pepper 3, Pepper 5 remains on the floor, and the table is empty. Since not all peppers are on the table, the plan node is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – it still looks promising.  
We have already collected Pepper 4 and Pepper 3, and the only remaining actions are to pick up Pepper 5 and then place the two peppers on Table 6. Those are straightforward, low‑cost steps, so the plan node can still be pursued.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human moved to (3.5, 1.5) and picked up Pepper 3.  
- Pepper 3 is now in the human’s hand; it is no longer at (3.5, 1.5).  
- The human already held Pepper 4, so now holds two peppers.  
- All other objects remain unchanged.

**Current facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5), holding Pepper 4 and Pepper 3 |
| Pepper 4 | in hand |
| Pepper 3 | in hand |
| Pepper 5 | (3.5, 1.0) |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | not present in the current perception |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. Pepper 3 could be picked up at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Table 6 remains empty.  
3. Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight.  

**Assumptions that proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| Pepper 3 could be picked up. | **Correct** |
| Table 6 remains empty. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room. | **Uncertain** (no evidence) |

The goal “place all peppers on the table” is now one step closer: two peppers are in hand, one pepper remains at (3.5, 1.0). The next minimal actions are to pick up Pepper 5 and then place all held peppers on Table 6.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.  
The plan “Place all of the peppers on the table” is still incomplete: two peppers (4 and 3) are in the human’s hand, one pepper (5) remains on the floor, and the table is still empty. The next minimal steps are to pick up Pepper 5 and then place all held peppers on Table 6.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No.  
The plan “Place all of the peppers on the table” is still incomplete: two peppers (4 and 3) are in the human’s hand, one pepper (5) remains on the floor, and the table is still empty. The next minimal steps are to pick up Pepper 5 and then place all held peppers on Table 6.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan is still promising.  
We already have two peppers in hand and only one remaining (pepper 5). The next minimal steps are to pick up pepper 5 and then place all held peppers on the table. Whether pepper 1 exists is still uncertain, but even if it does, it can be located and added later. Thus the plan can still be completed with a few more actions.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human moved to (3.5, 1.5) and picked up Pepper 5.  
- Pepper 5 is now in the human’s hand; it is no longer at (3.5, 1.0).  
- The human is still holding Pepper 4 and Pepper 3.  
- All other objects remain unchanged.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5), holding Pepper 4, Pepper 3, Pepper 5 |
| Pepper 4 | in hand |
| Pepper 3 | in hand |
| Pepper 5 | **in hand** |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | not present in the current perception |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. Pepper 5 was at (3.5, 1.0) and could be picked up.  
2. Picking up Pepper 5 brings us closer to “place all peppers on the table.”  
3. Table 6 remains empty.  
4. Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight.

**Assumptions that proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| Pepper 5 could be picked up. | **Correct** |
| Picking up Pepper 5 brings us closer to the goal. | **Correct** |
| Table 6 remains empty. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room. | **Uncertain** (no evidence) |

The goal “place all peppers on the table” is now one step closer: the human holds all three visible peppers. The next minimal actions are to move to Table 6 and place the peppers.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet completed.  
The reflection shows that the human holds all three visible peppers (4, 3, 5) and the table is still empty. The next required step is to move to the table and place the peppers there. Additionally, Pepper 1 remains unobserved, so the plan may still be incomplete if it exists.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No. The plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet completed.  
The reflection shows that the human holds all three visible peppers (4, 3, 5) and the table is still empty. The next required step is to move to the table and place the peppers there. Additionally, Pepper 1 remains unobserved, so the plan may still be incomplete if it exists.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

content='No – the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet finished. The reflection shows the human is holding peppers\u202f4,\u202f3, and\u202f5, but the table remains empty, and Pepper\u202f1 is still unobserved. The next step is to move to the table and place the held peppers there, and if Pepper\u202f1 exists it must also be placed.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'created_at': '2025-12-13T10:37:34.623312516Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 4014131006, 'load_duration': 133980250, 'prompt_eval_count': 4096, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1753944338, 'eval_count': 195, 'eval_duration': 2044121632, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--c95408d8-ad21-4c5d-8fac-81a80081ac10-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4096, 'output_tokens': 195, 'total_tokens': 4291}

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan is still promising. All visible peppers are already in hand, and the only remaining step is to move to Table 6 and place them. No new information or obstacles have emerged that would invalidate the goal.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: Yes – the plan is still promising. All visible peppers are already in hand, and the only remaining step is to move to Table 6 and place them. No new information or obstacles have emerged that would invalidate the goal.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 0.5).  
- No objects were picked up or placed; the action was purely a movement.  
- The table remains empty, and the human still holds Pepper 4, Pepper 3, and Pepper 5.  
- Pepper 1 is still not observed.

**Updated facts**

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5), holding Pepper 4, Pepper 3, Pepper 5 |
| Pepper 4 | in hand |
| Pepper 3 | in hand |
| Pepper 5 | in hand |
| Table 6 | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |
| Pepper 1 | not present in the current perception |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. Moving to the table’s location would allow the human to place the held peppers on it.  
2. The table remains empty until an explicit “place” action is taken.  
3. Pepper 1 still exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight.

**Assumptions that proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| Moving to the table’s location brings the human to the table. | **Correct** |
| The table remains empty until a “place” action is executed. | **Correct** |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room. | **Uncertain** (no evidence) |
| The movement itself would automatically place the peppers on the table. | **Wrong** – no placement occurred. |

**Next minimal step**

The human should now **place** the held peppers on Table 6 to satisfy the goal “place all of the peppers on the table.”

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet completed. The last action was only a movement to the table’s location; no peppers were placed on the table, so the goal remains unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No – the plan node “Place all of the peppers on the table” is not yet completed. The last action was only a movement to the table’s location; no peppers were placed on the table, so the goal remains unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan node is still promising.  
We have already collected all visible peppers (4, 3, 5) and are standing on the table, so a single “place” action will satisfy the goal. The only uncertainty is whether Pepper 1 exists elsewhere, but the plan can still be pursued and completed.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: Yes – the plan node is still promising.

| Human     | (3.5, 0.5), holding pepper 3 & pepper 5 |
| Pepper 4  | **on** table_6 |

### Assumptions made about the new state

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Dropping pepper 4 would place it on table 6 | **Correct** – pepper 4 is now on the table | ✔ |
| The table remains empty until an explicit “place” action | **Correct** – table was empty before the drop and still is (except for pepper 4) | ✔ |
| The human stays at the same location after the drop | **Correct** – still at (3.5, 0.5) | ✔ |
| Only the pepper being carried is dropped | **Correct** – pepper 3 & 5 remain in hand | ✔ |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight | **Uncertain** – no new evidence | ❓ |

---

**Summary**

The action successfully moved the held pepper 4 onto table 6. The human still holds the other two visible peppers, and Pepper 1 remains unobserved. All assumptions that the drop would place the pepper on the table, that the table stays empty until a drop, and that the human’s location doesn’t change were proven correct. The only remaining uncertainty is the existence/location of pepper 1.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – the plan node is not yet completed.  
We have only dropped pepper 4 onto the table; peppers 3 and 5 remain in the human’s inventory, and pepper 1 is still unobserved. The goal “place all of the peppers on the table” still requires placing the remaining peppers.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No – the plan node is not yet completed.  
We have only dropped pepper 4 onto the table; peppers 3 and 5 remain in the human’s inventory, and pepper 1 is still unobserved. The goal “place all of the peppers on the table” still requires placing the remaining peppers.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan remains promising.  
We have already dropped pepper 4 on the table and still hold the other two visible peppers. The only remaining uncertainty is pepper 1, but placing the remaining peppers on the table will satisfy the goal regardless of its presence. Thus the plan node is still viable.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped pepper_3 into table_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- I moved to the table’s location (3.5, 0.5) and **dropped pepper 3** onto table 6.  
- Pepper 3 is now on the surface of table 6 (table 6 now contains pepper 4 + pepper 3).  
- I still hold pepper 4 and pepper 5.  
- Table 6 remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is no longer empty – it now contains two peppers.  
- Pepper 1 is still not observed.

### Current facts

| Item      | Location / Status |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Human     | (3.5, 0.5), holding pepper 4 & pepper 5 |
| Pepper 4  | **on** table_6 |
| Pepper 3  | **on** table_6 |
| Pepper 5  | in hand |
| Table 6   | (3.5, 0.5) – contains pepper 4 & pepper 3 |
| Pepper 1  | not present in the current perception |

---

### Assumptions about the new state

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Dropping the carried pepper places it on table 6 | ✔ – pepper 3 is now on the table |
| Only the pepper being carried is dropped | ✔ – pepper 4 & 5 remain in hand |
| The human stays at the same location after the drop | ✔ – still at (3.5, 0.5) |
| The table remains empty until a drop action | ✔ – it was empty before the drop and now contains peppers |
| Pepper 1 exists somewhere in the room but is out of sight | ❓ – no new evidence |

---

**Summary**

The action successfully placed pepper 3 on table 6. I still hold pepper 4 and pepper 5, and Pepper 1 remains unobserved. All assumptions about the drop’s effect and the human’s location proved correct; the only remaining uncertainty is the existence/location of pepper 1.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – the plan node is not yet completed.  
The last reflection shows that the human still holds pepper 5 (and pepper 4 is already on the table), so not all peppers have been placed on the table. The goal “Place all of the peppers on the table” remains unfinished.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Reasoning: No – the plan node is not yet completed.  
The last reflection shows that the human still holds pepper 5 (and pepper 4 is already on the table), so not all peppers have been placed on the table. The goal “Place all of the peppers on the table” remains unfinished.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan is still promising.  
All visible peppers except pepper 5 are already on the table, and the agent is at the table’s location with pepper 5 in hand. Dropping pepper 5 will satisfy the goal “place all of the peppers on the table.” The only remaining uncertainty is the existence/location of pepper 1, but that does not affect the feasibility of completing the current plan node.

Question: The focused plan node is not completed because: None. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: Yes – the plan is still promising.  
All visible peppers except pepper 5 are already on the table, and the agent is at the table’s location with pepper 5 in hand. Dropping pepper 5 will satisfy the goal “place all of the peppers on the table.” The only remaining uncertainty is the existence/location of pepper 1, but that does not affect the feasibility of completing the current plan node.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.
