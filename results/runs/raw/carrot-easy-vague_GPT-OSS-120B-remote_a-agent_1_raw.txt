[observer] I see that I am in the main room at position (0.5, 0.5). My inventory holds a carrot (id carrot_4). In the room there is a table (id table_3) located at (1.0, 4.0) and its surface is empty.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the move**

- The human is now standing at the table’s location (1.0, 4.0); the previous position (0.5, 0.5) is no longer occupied.
- The inventory still contains the carrot (id carrot_4); it has not been placed yet.
- The table (id table_3) remains in the room and its surface is still empty.
- No other objects or doors were affected by the move.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. *The human could reach the table directly.* → **Correct** (the move succeeded).
2. *The table’s surface would stay empty until the carrot is put on it.* → **Correct**.
3. *Carrot stays in inventory after moving.* → **Correct**.
4. *No obstacles or collisions prevented the movement.* → **Correct** (the action executed).

All the assumptions held true; the only thing still pending is placing the carrot onto the table.

[observer] Observation: I am in the main room at position (1.0, 4.0). My inventory contains the carrot (id carrot_4). The table (id table_3) is at my position and its surface is empty.  

Action: place carrot_4 on table_3.
