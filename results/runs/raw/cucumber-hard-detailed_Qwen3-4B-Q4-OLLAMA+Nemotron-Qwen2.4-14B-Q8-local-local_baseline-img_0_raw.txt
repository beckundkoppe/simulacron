[action_imaginator] Pick up the cucumber.

The goal is to pick up the cucumber and place it on the table with the minimal action sequence. The human starts at (0.0, 0.0), and the cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5). Since the human must be at the cucumber's position to pick it up, the first action is to move directly to (3.5, 1.5). This minimizes the path and avoids unnecessary actions, such as interacting with other objects (e.g., the potato or chest) that are irrelevant to the goal.

[action_imaginator] drop cucumber_3 on table_4

```
**Action:** drop cucumber_3 on table_4
```
```output
[ACTION EXECUTED] dropped cucumber_3 on table_4
```
```system
You are in a room with a table and a chest. You have a cucumber in your inventory. The table is empty. The chest is closed and unlocked. There's also a potato in the room.

Goal: Place the cucumber on the table.

Possible actions:
- Move to a position (x, y) within the room (0 <= x <= 4, 0 <= y <= 2).
- Take an object by its id (e.g., take cucumber_3).
- Drop an object by its id (e.g., drop cucumber_3 on table_4).
- Open, close, lock, unlock an object by its id (e.g., open chest_5).
- Go through a door (if any) by its id.
- Look through a door (if any) by its id.

You must choose the minimal action sequence that achieves the goal.

Current state:
- Your position: (3.5, 0.5)
- Inventory: [cucumber_3]
- Perception:
  - Chest: closed, unlocked, empty
  - Potato: at (0.5, 1.5)
  - Table: at (3.5, 0.5), empty

Goal: Place the cucumber on the table.

What is the best next action?
```
The current position is already at the table (3.5, 0.5), and the cucumber is in the inventory. The goal is to place the cucumber on the table, which requires dropping it on the table. Since the player is already at the table's position, no movement is needed. The minimal action is to directly drop the cucumber on the table.

**Action:** drop cucumber_3 on table_4

This action achieves the goal in one step, which is the minimal sequence.
