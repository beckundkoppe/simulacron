[plan_imaginator] **Initial Structured Plan – “Place a potato on the table”**

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Locate potato** | Scan the room (or recall known location) to determine where the potato is situated. |
| 2 | **Move to potato** | Walk directly to the potato’s position. |
| 3 | **Take potato** | Pick up the potato (use the “take” command). |
| 4 | **Locate table** | Identify the table’s location (if not already known). |
| 5 | **Move to table** | Walk straight to the table. |
| 6 | **Drop potato on table** | Place the potato onto the tabletop (use the “drop” command). |

*Notes:*  
- If any doors or obstacles lie between the current position and the potato/table, insert the minimal required “open/close/go through” actions before the corresponding move step.  
- No extra actions (e.g., looking around, unnecessary inventory changes) are included; the sequence is the minimal path to achieve the goal.

The plan’s current step is “take potato.” The reflection indicates that there is no potato in the room—only a door, a key, a box (containing a diamond), and an empty table. Since the required object (potato) does not exist in the environment, the action “take potato” cannot be performed, and thus the step remains incomplete.

**Current facts:**  
- Door (closed, unlocked)  
- Key (on the floor)  
- Box (closed, contains a diamond)  
- Empty table  
- No potato present in the room

**Assumptions made:**  
- A potato was required to fulfill the request.  
- The room’s inventory did not include a potato.

**Outcome:** The assumption that “no potato is available” proved correct, so the goal cannot be achieved and the state remains unchanged.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No, it is not promising. The goal requires a potato, and the environment contains no potato to obtain or create. Since the necessary object does not exist, the step cannot be completed, and there is no feasible way to achieve the desired outcome.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:**  
No actions were actually executed because there was nothing to act on.

**Current facts:**  
- Door (closed, unlocked)  
- Key (on the floor)  
- Box (closed, contains a diamond)  
- Empty table  
- No potato present in the room

**Assumptions made:**  
- A potato was required to fulfil the request.  
- The room’s inventory did not include a potato.

**Outcome:**  
The assumption that “no potato is available” was correct, so the goal cannot be achieved and the state remains unchanged.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I see a closed, unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0), a key at (3.0, 1.0), a closed box containing a diamond at (1.0, 1.0), and an empty table at (0.0, 4.0). There is no potato in the room.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] No possible action – the goal cannot be achieved because there is no potato in the environment.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:** None – no actions could be executed because there was no potato to take.

**Current facts**
- Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0)  
- Key at (3.0, 1.0)  
- Box (closed) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond  
- Table at (0.0, 4.0) – empty  
- No potato present in the room  
- Inventory is empty

**Assumptions made**
- A potato is required to fulfil the request.  
- No potato exists in the environment.

**Outcome of assumptions:** Both assumptions were correct; therefore the goal cannot be achieved and the state remains unchanged.

**Reasoning:** The current reflection reports that there is no potato in the room, so the required action “take a potato and place it on the table” cannot be performed. Since the necessary object is missing, the plan step of putting a potato on the table has not been executed.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The reflection shows there is no potato in the environment, so the required action of taking a potato and placing it on the table could not be performed. Therefore the plan step of placing a potato on the table is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The plan is not promising because the required object—a potato—is absent from the room. Without a potato to take and place, the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved, so no further action can make the step succeed.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The reflection shows there is no potato in the environment, so the required action of taking a potato and placing it on the table could not be performed. Therefore the plan step of placing a potato on the table is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: No. The plan is not promising because the required object—a potato—is absent from the room. Without a potato to take and place, the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved, so no further action can make the step succeed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:** None – no action could be taken because there was no potato to pick up.

**Current facts**  
- Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0)  
- Key at (3.0, 1.0)  
- Box (closed) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond  
- Table at (0.0, 4.0) – empty  
- Inventory: empty  
- No potato exists in the room

**Assumptions made**  
- A potato is required to satisfy the request.  
- The room contains no potato.

**Outcome of assumptions**  
Both assumptions were correct; therefore the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved and the state remains unchanged.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:** None – no actions could be taken because there is no potato to pick up.  

**Current facts**  
- Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0)  
- Key at (3.0, 1.0)  
- Box (closed) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond  
- Table at (0.0, 4.0), empty  
- Inventory: empty  

**Assumptions made**  
- A potato is required to fulfill the request.  
- No potato exists in the room.  

**Result:** Both assumptions were correct; therefore the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved, and the state remains unchanged.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The goal was to have a potato on the table. The current state shows that there is no potato in the room and the table remains empty, so the goal has not been achieved. **No, the initial main goal is not reached.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflection states that the plan was to place a potato on the table, but it concluded that no potato exists and the goal is unattainable. Since the required action (placing a potato) was not performed, the focused plan step is **not completed**. It was only evaluated and determined impossible.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last reflection states that the plan was to place a potato on the table, but it concluded that no potato exists and the goal is unattainable. Since the required action (placing a potato) was not performed, the focused plan step is **not completed**. It was only evaluated and determined impossible.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I see a closed, unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0); a key at (3.0, 1.0); a closed box at (1.0, 1.0) that contains a diamond; and an empty table at (0.0, 4.0). There is no potato in the room.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] No action possible – there is no potato in the room to pick up and place on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
We inspected the room, listed every visible object (door, key, box with diamond, and table) and verified that none of them is a potato. The reflection confirms that the check was performed and the absence of a potato was established, so the plan step “check objects and confirm there is no potato” is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the goal is not reached.

**Reasoning:** The latest reflection shows that no actions were performed and the environment still contains only a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table – there is no potato present. Since there is nothing to pick up and place, the requirement “place a potato on the table” cannot be satisfied. The state remains unchanged, so the initial main goal has not been achieved.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:** None – no actions could be executed because there was no potato to pick up.

**Current facts**
- Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0)  
- Key at (3.0, 1.0)  
- Box (closed) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond  
- Table at (0.0, 4.0) – empty  
- No potato present in the room  
- Inventory is empty  

**Assumptions made**
- A potato is required to satisfy the request.  
- The room contains no potato, making the goal impossible.

**Result:** Both assumptions were correct; the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved, and the state remains unchanged.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes** – the current (and only) plan step was to determine whether the goal could be carried out. By inspecting the room we found no potato, concluded that the goal “place a potato on the table” is impossible, and no further actions are required. This completes the focused step.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.  
The latest reflection shows that the room contains only a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table—there is no potato present and no action has placed anything on the table. Therefore the goal “place a potato on the table” has not been achieved.

Reasoning: No.  
The latest reflection shows that the room contains only a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table—there is no potato present and no action has placed anything on the table. Therefore the goal “place a potato on the table” has not been achieved.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the focused plan step is completed.**  
The last reflection already communicated that the room contains no potato and that no object can be turned into one, so the explanation required by the plan has been given. No further actions are needed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **Yes – the focused plan step is completed.**  
The last reflection already communicated that the room contains no potato and that no object can be turned into one, so the explanation required by the plan has been given. No further actions are needed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

Reasoning: The goal has **not** been reached. The environment contains a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table, but there is no potato to pick up and place on the table. Since the required object does not exist, the action “place a potato on the table” cannot be fulfilled.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions**  
No actions were executed because there was no potato to pick up. Consequently, the world state is unchanged.

**Current facts**  
- Door (door_8) is **closed** and **unlocked** at (4.0, 4.0).  
- Key (key_7) lies on the floor at (3.0, 1.0).  
- Box (box_6) is **closed** at (1.0, 1.0) and contains a diamond (diamond_5).  
- Table (table_4) is **empty** at (0.0, 4.0).  
- **No potato** exists anywhere in the room.  
- Inventory is empty.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato is required to satisfy “place a potato on the table.”  
2. The room contains no potato, so the goal is unattainable.  

**Outcome of assumptions**  
Both assumptions were correct; therefore the goal could not be achieved and the state remains exactly as listed above.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The last reflection states that there is no potato to pick up, so the intended action (taking a potato and putting it on the table) cannot be performed. Since no further actions are possible and the plan cannot proceed, the current plan step is considered finished.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.  
The current state still has an empty table and no potato in the environment, so the required action of putting a potato on the table cannot have been performed. The goal remains unmet.

Reasoning: No.  
The current state still has an empty table and no potato in the environment, so the required action of putting a potato on the table cannot have been performed. The goal remains unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Initial main goal is not yet reached
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] I cannot place a potato on the table because there is no potato in the room. The available objects are a door, a key, a closed box containing a diamond, and an empty table, none of which can become a potato. Therefore the requested goal cannot be achieved in the current environment.

[user] Plan: I cannot place a potato on the table because there is no potato in the room. The available objects are a door, a key, a closed box containing a diamond, and an empty table, none of which can become a potato. Therefore the requested goal cannot be achieved in the current environment.
Use toolcalls to add the steps specified in the plan for the user.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I see a closed, unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0); a key at (3.0, 1.0); a closed box at (1.0, 1.0) that contains a diamond; and an empty table at (0.0, 4.0). No potato is present.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] No possible action – there is no potato in the room to place on the table.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of actions:** none – no action could be executed because there is no potato to pick up.

**Current facts**
- Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0)  
- Key at (3.0, 1.0)  
- Box (closed) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond  
- Table at (0.0, 4.0) – empty  
- Inventory: empty  
- **No potato** exists in the room.

**Assumptions made**
1. A potato is required to satisfy “place a potato on the table.”  
2. The room contains no potato, so the goal cannot be achieved.

**Outcome:** Both assumptions are correct; the goal is unattainable with the current objects, and the world state remains unchanged.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflection shows that no potato exists in the room, so the only possible plan step – recognizing that the goal cannot be achieved – has been carried out. Therefore the focused plan step is completed. **Yes**.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last reflection shows that no potato exists in the room, so the only possible plan step – recognizing that the goal cannot be achieved – has been carried out. Therefore the focused plan step is completed. **Yes**.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The current state still has an empty table and no potato in the room, so the goal “place a potato on the table” has not been achieved.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: No. The current state still has an empty table and no potato in the room, so the goal “place a potato on the table” has not been achieved.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] There is no potato in the room and no way to create one from the available objects, so the goal cannot be achieved; no further action is possible.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the actions taken:**  
No actions were actually executed because there was no potato available to pick up and place on the table.

**Current facts**  
- **Door** – closed, unlocked, located at (4.0, 4.0).  
- **Key** – lying on the floor at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Box** – closed, located at (1.0, 1.0); it contains a diamond.  
- **Table** – empty, located at (0.0, 4.0).  
- **Inventory** – empty.  
- **Potato** – does not exist anywhere in the room.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato is required to satisfy the request “place a potato on the table.”  
2. The room contains no potato.

**Outcome of the assumptions**  
- Both assumptions were correct. Because no potato is present, the goal cannot be achieved, and therefore no state change occurred.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to obtain a potato, but the current state still shows no potato in the environment and no actions have been taken to acquire one, so the step is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The environment contains only a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table—no potato and no means to create or acquire one from the given objects. Since there is no source for a potato, the plan “obtain a potato” cannot be fulfilled.

**Conclusion:** The plan does not appear promising.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to obtain a potato, but the current state still shows no potato in the environment and no actions have been taken to acquire one, so the step is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The environment contains only a door, a key, a closed box with a diamond, and an empty table—no potato and no means to create or acquire one from the given objects. Since there is no source for a potato, the plan “obtain a potato” cannot be fulfilled.

**Conclusion:** The plan does not appear promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because There is no potato in the environment and no way to create or acquire one from the existing objects, so the plan to obtain a potato cannot be fulfilled and is not promising.
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] The goal cannot be achieved because there is no potato in the environment to pick up and place on the table. No actions can be performed.

[user] Plan: The goal cannot be achieved because there is no potato in the environment to pick up and place on the table. No actions can be performed.
Use toolcalls to add the steps specified in the plan for the user.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I see a closed, unlocked door (door_8) at (4.0, 4.0), a key (key_7) at (3.0, 1.0), a closed box (box_6) at (1.0, 1.0) containing a diamond (diamond_5), and an empty table (table_4) at (0.0, 4.0). There is no potato in the room.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] No action – the goal cannot be achieved because there is no potato in the room.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
