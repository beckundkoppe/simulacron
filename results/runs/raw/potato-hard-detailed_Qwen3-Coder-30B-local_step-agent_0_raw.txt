[observer] I observe a key at position (3.0,1.0) and a door at position (4.0,4.0) that is closed but unlocked. 

The key is relevant for my goal since I need to open the door to reach the other room where the potato is located. The door is currently closed, so I need to use the key to open it first. 

I don't see any potato in my current room (main). The potato is in the other room, which I cannot access yet because the door is closed. I need to open the door first before I can go to the other room to find the potato.

- Can return through door_8 (CORRECT - door was already open)

**Assumptions proven wrong:**
- Assumed potato was not in box_11 or chest_12 (WRONG - it was in chest_12)
- Assumed I needed to search entire room (WRONG - found it in chest)

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discoveries:**
- Potato_9 is in inventory (collected from chest_12)
- Table_4 is empty (as observed earlier)
- Door_8 is open and unlocked (already known, but confirmed)

**Relevant for Goal:**
The potato is in inventory and I am in the main room. The next step is to place the potato on table_4.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Put potato_9 on table_4.

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 4.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 4.0, "y": 4.0}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "key", "id": "key_7"}, {"name": "diamond", "id": "diamond_10"}, {"name": "potato", "id": "potato_9"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_4", "position": "(0.0,4.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "box", "id": "box_6", "position": "(1.0,1.0)", "contents_count": "contains 1", "contents": [{"name": "diamond", "id": "diamond_5"}]}, {"name": "door", "id": "door_8", "position": "(4.0,4.0)", "state": "open", "lock_state": "unlocked"}]} Reasoning: Put potato_9 on table_4. Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
