Goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [6] Place the carrot from your inventory on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan isn’t yet detailed enough: to put the carrot on the table the human must first be at the table’s location. The high‑level step “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” needs to be broken into at least two concrete actions (e.g., move to the table, then drop the carrot). So the current plan tree should be further decomposed before execution.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No – the plan isn’t yet broken down into the primitive actions the human can actually perform. “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” presumes the human is already standing at the table and holding the carrot, but the current state may require moving there first and then dropping the item. To be executable we need at least two sub‑steps:

1. **Navigate to the table** (e.g., walk/move to the table’s location).  
2. **Put down the carrot** (drop or place the carrot from the inventory onto the table).

Only after these low‑level actions are specified can the plan be executed safely and minimally.
