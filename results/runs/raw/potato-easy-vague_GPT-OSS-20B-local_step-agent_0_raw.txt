[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

- The agent attempted to pick up a potato, move to the table, and place it there.  
- No potato was found in the room, so the pick‑up action failed.  
- Consequently, the agent could not place anything on the table.

**Facts in the new state**

- The room contains no potato.  
- The table remains empty.  
- The agent is still in the same location (no movement occurred).

**Assumptions made**

1. A potato existed in the room.  
2. The potato was reachable and could be picked up.  
3. The table was a valid placement location.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- Assumption 1: No potato was present.  
- Assumption 2: The pick‑up could not succeed because the object was absent.  
- Assumption 3: The table was still empty (no new object placed).

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**  
- The agent tried to pick up a potato, walk to the table, and place it there.  
- No potato was found, so the pick‑up failed and nothing was placed on the table.  
- The agent’s position and the environment remained unchanged.

**Facts in the new state**  
- Table at (0, 3) is empty.  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Door at (4, 4) is closed and unlocked.  
- No potato is present in the room.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato existed in the room.  
2. The potato was reachable and could be picked up.  
3. The table was a valid placement location.

**Assumptions that proved right/wrong**  
- **Wrong**: Assumption 1 (no potato existed).  
- **Wrong**: Assumption 2 (pick‑up could not succeed).  
- **Right**: Assumption 3 (the table is a valid location; it remains empty).  
- The door’s status (closed/unlocked) was unchanged and remains true.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**  
- The agent tried to pick up a potato, walk to the table, and place it there.  
- No potato was found, so the pick‑up failed and nothing was placed on the table.  
- The agent’s position (4, 4) and the environment remained unchanged.

**Facts in the new state**  
- Table at (0, 3) is empty.  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Door at (4, 4) is closed and unlocked.  
- Agent is at (4, 4).  
- No potato is present in the room.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato existed in the room.  
2. The potato could be picked up.  
3. The table is a valid placement location.  
4. Moving to the door is possible.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Moving to the door succeeded.

- No potato existed.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**  
- The agent tried to pick up a potato, walk to the table, and place it there.  
- No potato was found, so the pickup failed and nothing was placed on the table.  
- The agent remains at the door (4, 4).

**Current facts**  
- Table at (0, 3) is empty.  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Door at (4, 4) is closed and unlocked.  
- Agent is at (4, 4).  
- No potato is present in the room.

**Assumptions made**  
1. A potato existed in the room.  
2. The potato could be picked up.  
3. The table is a valid placement location.  
4. Moving to the door is possible.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- The table is a valid location (remains empty).  
- Moving to the door succeeded.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- No potato existed.  
- The potato‑pickup could not succeed.

- The action “open door_6” succeeded, changing the door’s state from closed to open.  
- No other objects were affected (the table stays empty, the key remains at (3, 1), and no potato exists).

**Current facts**  
- `door_6` is **open**.  
- `table_0_3` is **empty**.  
- `key` is at **(3, 1)**.  
- The agent is at the door (4, 4).  
- No potato is present.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
- The door was indeed closed and unlocked before opening.  
- The agent’s position is unchanged (still at the door).  
- The table remains empty.  
- No potato exists in the room.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Door was closed and unlocked.  
- Agent is at the door.  
- Table remains empty.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- Existence of a potato (there is none).
