- The human moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- The cucumber remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- The table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.

| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. **The cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5).**  
   *Proved right* – the cucumber is indeed there.

2. **The human can move to (3.5, 1.5).**  
   *Proved right* – the move succeeded.

3. **The cucumber is not on the table.**  
   *Proved right* – the cucumber remains on the floor, not on the table.

4. **The next step to place the cucumber on the table would involve picking it up and moving it to (3.5, 0.5).**  
   *Not yet tested* – the action performed was only the move to the cucumber, not the pick‑up or placement.

Thus, the action achieved the intermediate goal of positioning the human at the cucumber but did not yet place the cucumber on the table.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

1. **pick cucumber** – cucumber moved from the floor to the human’s inventory.  
2. **move to (3.5, 0.5)** – human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to the table’s location.  
3. **place cucumber** – cucumber was placed on the table, leaving the floor empty.

**Current facts**

| Human    | (3.5, 0.5) | at table        |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 0.5) | on the table    |
| Table    | (3.5, 0.5) | not empty       |

**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber was at the human’s location before picking. **Proved right**.  
2. The human could pick the cucumber. **Proved right**.  
3. The human could move to (3.5, 0.5). **Proved right**.  
4. The cucumber could be placed on the table. **Proved right**.  
5. The table remained empty after placement. **Proved wrong** – the table is now occupied by the cucumber.
