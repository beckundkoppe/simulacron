The cucumber is at position (3.5,1.5) but its id is \'cucumber_3\'.\n\nSo to move near it, we\'d use `move_to_object` with object_id="cucumber_3", which would move us to wherever that object is (which according to perception is at (3.5, 0.5), wait no: "position": "(3.5,1.5)" for cucumber.\n\nSimilarly the table has id \'table_4\' and position (3.5, 0.5).\n\nTherefore correct toolcalls should use `move_to_object` with respective ids:\n\n```json\n[\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n  {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},\n  {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nBut the original problem statement says: "The human moves to a position." for both `move_to_position` and `move_to_object`. That seems incorrect/buggy.\nAssuming that\'s typo and `move_to_object` is correct (as it takes object_id not coordinates), then my second version is correct.\n\nIf however, as per task description we are literally to move toward specific positions then `position`-based version may be expected despite objects having ids.\n\nGiven ambiguity in function descriptions sharing same text vs position references in task statement, first set of toolcalls using exact positions (not object ids) would likely match the problem\'s intent:\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "0.5"}},\n    {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nHowever if we follow the function definition literally where both move_to_object and move_to_position have identical descriptions implying perhaps the one with position as params was intended (and object one might be redundant), then second version is correct.\n\nGiven that and since problem states positions explicitly, first json array is likely intended answer.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3122, 'prompt_tokens': 1201, 'total_tokens': 4323, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-187', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0284-c03a-7860-9919-88ec2080574d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1201, 'output_tokens': 3122, 'total_tokens': 4323, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='**Summary of Reasoning:**\nThe task involves moving "right" from the current position. Given that the only physical objects are a table and a cucumber (the latter being on top of the table), the most plausible interpretation is to move towards the table since it is located in the positive x direction, which corresponds to "right."

content='The final step-by-step toolcalls generated based on the reasoning are:\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "0.5"}},\n    {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, considering that `move_to_object` might be more appropriate for moving near the table, an alternative sequence would replace step 3 with:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n```\n\nBut since both methods should logically achieve the same result (placing cucumber on table), and given positions are explicitly provided, sticking with spatial coordinates is straightforward unless problem expects exclusive use of object-based movement.\n\nGiven that both methods could be correct, but the initial room description specifies exact coordinates for objects which might be more precise if the interaction requires specific distance handling, we might prefer coordinate movements. However since `move_to_object` is likely designed to position near interactable objects optimally, it may also be preferred by the system.\n\nGiven no explicit preference, and since both approaches logically satisfy the task\'s requirements for movement and interaction proximity (with coordinates providing precise positioning), the first sequence based on positions is likely acceptable.\n\nBut reviewing task instructions: "Toolcall order matters" and we should use correct object ids where applicable. The cucumber and table both have ids provided ("cucumber_3", "table_4"), and actions involve them directly except for floor as implicit source. So perhaps system expects explicit object references where available--in which case `move_to_object` might be preferred over position-based moves.\n\nRevised sequence using `move_to_object`:\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},  # move to cucumber\'s position (since it\'s on floor, not in container)\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},  # pick up from floor\n    {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},  # move near table\n    {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}  # place onto table\n]\n```\n\nBoth sequences achieve the task. The first one explicitly handles movement by coordinates, which is more low-level and potentially more precise; the second one abstracts table\'s position handling to the system.\n\nGiven that `move_to_position` for initial cucumber pick up seems necessary (since cucumber isn\'t in an object, just at a position with floor implicit), the hybrid approach might be most robust:\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n    {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},\n    {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nThis ensures:\n1. Precise pickup by coordinates where item is floor-based\n2. High-level movement near table (handles any internal object distance logic)\n3. Action using explicit object ids where available\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_position": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n    {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},\n    {"drop_to": {"to_id": "table_4", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3043, 'prompt_tokens': 1177, 'total_tokens': 4220, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-354', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0287-3708-7331-bc64-2cd11bc1a77f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1177, 'output_tokens': 3043, 'total_tokens': 4220, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Go to cucumber and take it

To find the cucumber: you need to move in positive y direction until your y coordinate  is greater than 0
From the map - your initial y position is 0. Cucumber's position on the map is at 3.5 for x, but you already have enough in y (1.5 as opposed to yours at 0).

So I will move south then east

Then when you get to cucumber's location: take it action and it will go to your inventory

content='### Final Answer:\n```json\n[\n    {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}},\n    {"take_from": {"from_id": "FLOOR", "what_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, reading back the problem statement carefully: the task is to generate tool calls arising from a specific planned action, which in this case is "Go to cucumber and take it".\n\nSince both tools (move_to_object and move_to_position) can achieve part of this plan, but move_to_object seems higher level abstraction for \'go to object\' part, so I\'ll stick with above.\n\nBut wait, the cucumber might be on the floor near the table at that position. The description says contents_count is empty for table, and there\'s separately a cucumber positioned nearby (3.5,1.5) vs table is at (3.5,0.5). So yes it\'s on floor at that spot.\n\nThus the tool calls are correct as above.\n\nBut let me think if there\'s any sequence or dependency issue:\n\n- first move to object: this will position you near cucumber which at (3.5,1.5).\n- then take: now you\'re near enough to pick up item at ("cucumber_3") from floor.\n\nSeems correct order. No parallelism or other steps needed here.\n\nTherefore final answer is sequence of these two tool calls in that order.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1756, 'prompt_tokens': 1213, 'total_tokens': 2969, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-110', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b028b-845c-7fc3-8a6d-1a659c7ac16a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1213, 'output_tokens': 1756, 'total_tokens': 2969, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
