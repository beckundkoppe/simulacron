. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

- The human is now standing at the location of **cucumber_3** (the coordinates have changed from the starting point to the cucumber’s position).  
- No other state changes have occurred yet: the cucumber is still on the floor (or wherever it was), and the human is not yet holding anything.

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *The cucumber is reachable*: I assumed there are no obstacles or locked doors preventing access.  
   - **Result:** This proved correct; the move succeeded without any blockage.

2. *The cucumber can be taken*: I presumed the cucumber is a pick‑up‑able object.  
   - **Result:** Still untested; the “take” action hasn’t been performed yet.

3. *The table is nearby enough to be reached after the cucumber is taken*: I expected the next step (moving to the table) to be feasible.  
   - **Result:** Not yet verified; we’ll see after moving to the table.

**Summary**

The only verified change is the human’s position: now at the cucumber. All other assumptions remain to be confirmed by the upcoming “take” and “drop” actions.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

**Reasoning:**  
The purpose of the plan was to locate the cucumber. The current perception shows the cucumber already at the human’s position (3.5, 1.5), so it has been located. Checking the refrigerator is unnecessary because the cucumber is already found, therefore the plan’s objective is satisfied.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the executed actions**

- **Position:** You are standing at (3.5, 1.5) – the location of the cucumber.  
- **Inventory:** You are now holding **cucumber_3**.  
- **Cucumber:** No longer on the floor; it is in your inventory.  
- **Table:** Still at (3.5, 0.5) — unchanged.  
- **Other objects (potato, chest, etc.):** Unchanged.

**Assumptions and outcomes**

| Assumption | Was it needed? | Result |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| The cucumber was reachable. | Yes (to move to it). | ✔ Proved correct – you could stand on it. |
| The cucumber could be taken. | Yes (to execute `take`). | ✔ Proved correct – the cucumber was collected. |
| No obstacles/blockers between you and the table. | Not yet tested (you haven’t moved to the table). | Still presumed true; no evidence against it. |
| The table is close enough to reach after picking up the cucumber. | Not yet tested. | Still assumed true; will be verified on the next move. |

In short: you successfully picked up the cucumber; all prior assumptions about reachability and pick‑up ability were correct. The only untested assumptions are about the table’s accessibility, which will be confirmed when you move toward it.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The facts show that after the previous actions you are now holding **cucumber_3** (it is in your inventory). Since the plan was simply to pick up the cucumber, that goal has already been achieved.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Current facts**

- **Position:** You are standing at the table’s location (3.5, 0.5).  
- **Inventory:** You are still holding **cucumber_3** (the drop has not been executed yet).  
- **Cucumber:** No longer on the floor; it is in your inventory.  
- **Table:** Present at (3.5, 0.5) with an empty surface.  
- **Other objects:**  
  - Potato `potato_6` at (0.5, 1.5).  
  - Chest `chest_5` at (2.0, 2.0), closed but unlocked and empty.  

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. *The table is reachable from the cucumber’s location.* – Needed to move.  
2. *Moving onto the table does not automatically place the held item on it.* – Expected that you remain holding the cucumber until an explicit `drop` command.  
3. *No obstacles or doors block the path between the cucumber and the table.* – Required for the move to succeed.  

**What proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The table is reachable from the cucumber’s spot. | ✔ Correct – you successfully moved onto the table. |
| You remain holding the cucumber after moving. | ✔ Correct – the inventory still contains the cucumber. |
| No obstacles block the path. | ✔ Correct – the move succeeded without any hindrance. |

**Summary (short)**  
You have moved from the cucumber’s location to the table, are now standing at the table, and are still carrying the cucumber. All reachability and “no‑obstacle” assumptions held true; the only pending step is to issue `drop(cucumber_3, table_4)` to complete the original goal.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is completed.**  
The current facts show the human is already standing at the table’s coordinates (3.5, 0.5), so the “move to the table” step has been carried out. No further movement is needed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
Place the cucumber on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Action:** `drop(cucumber_3, table_4)`

[user] Plan:
Place the cucumber on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action
