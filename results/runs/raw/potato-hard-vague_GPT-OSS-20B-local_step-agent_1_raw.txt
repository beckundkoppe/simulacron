Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**  
No action was actually carried out; the human remained at (0, 0). The room state is unchanged.

**Resulting facts**  
- Human at (0, 0).  
- Table at (0, 4) is empty.  
- No potato exists in the room.  
- Key at (3, 1).  
- Box at (1, 1) contains a diamond.  
- Door at (4, 4) is closed and unlocked.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. A potato was present in the room.  
2. The table was empty.  
3. The human could reach the table.  
4. The human could move to (4, 4) (if that action were taken).

**Assumptions proved**  
- **Potato existed** – **false** (none present).  
- **Table was empty** – **true**.  
- **Human could reach the table** – irrelevant (no potato to move).  
- **Human could move to (4, 4)** – **true** (action would succeed if attempted).

**Conclusion**  
The goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved because no potato is available. No changes occurred in the environment.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Action | Resulting change |
|--------|------------------|
| `opened door_8` | Door at (4, 4) goes from *closed* → *open* (remains unlocked). |
| `move to key_3` | Human moves from (4, 4) to (3, 1). |
| `collected key_7` | Key at (3, 1) is removed from the world and added to the agent’s inventory. |

**Current facts**

- Human is at position (3, 1).  
- Door door_8 at (4, 4) is **open** (still unlocked).  
- Key key_7 is in the agent’s inventory.  
- Box box_6 at (1, 1) contains a diamond.  
- Table table_4 at (0, 4) remains empty.  
- No potato is present.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The door was closed and unlocked before opening.  
2. The agent could open the door.  
3. Opening the door changes its state to open but leaves it unlocked.  
4. The agent can move to the key’s location.  
5. The agent can collect the key when standing on it.  
6. No other objects or positions are affected by opening the door or collecting the key.  
7. (Earlier) A potato existed in the world – *not a state‑change assumption, but was made.*

**Assumptions that proved right**

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 – all hold true.  
- The earlier incorrect assumption that a potato existed is false and irrelevant to the state‑change.

**Summary**

The actions successfully opened the door, moved the agent to the key, and collected the key into inventory. The world now contains only the box with a diamond and an empty table; the door remains unlocked and open, and the agent is at (3, 1). All state‑change assumptions were correct; the only false assumption was the existence of a potato.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] New discoveries:  
- I have the key in my inventory.  
- The door at (4, 4) is open (still unlocked).  
- The box at (1, 1) contains a diamond.
