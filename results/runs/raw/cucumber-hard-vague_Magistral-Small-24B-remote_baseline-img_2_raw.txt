content='The action plan involves moving directly towards the cucumber at position (3.5, 1.5) by using its specified ID (`cucumber_3`). This method is efficient as it directly targets the desired object without needing separate coordinates.\n\nHere\'s how this would translate into tool calls:\n\n1. First, I will move to the position of `cucumber_3` using the appropriate function and then the next steps follow logically based on what interaction or operation is needed after moving to that position.\n\nSo the required  Toolcall is:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}\n```\n\nBut wait, since we have both functions available. I might need to check if there are other steps involved in the task once reaching the cucumber. However, based on the initial instructions, only the movement towards `cucumber_3` is specified.\n\nSo to strictly adhere to moving towards the cucumber:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_position", "x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}\n```\n\nis an alternative if we prefer using position over object_id, but since both are available and `move_to_object` is more specific.\n\nThus final tool call is:\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}]\n```\n\nThis seems correct. But then, looking at the initial instruction, it is to give tool calls arising from \'planned action\' which in this case was reasoned as moving towards cucumber 3 directly by the ID. Both methods appear feasible but leveraging the object\'s identity (ID) is more semantically aligned with the objects present.\n\nHowever considering that `move_to_object` does not exist in the original function listing provided earlier, I see it seems like a duplicate or incorrectly considered function based on initial description. Wait checking initial list:\n\nOriginal functions are move_to_position and move_to_object. But in the provided problem setup, there is some confusion; both seem listed similarly in description but with different signatures.\n\nWait  - function descriptions:\nmove_to_position: takes x,y coordinates\nmove_to_object: also says "the human moves to a position" which seems inconsistent in naming.\n\nBut parameters for move_to_object shows a single object_id parameter. So likely \'move_to_object\' is meant to move towards another person or entity not based on coordinates but by their identifier.\n\nGiven that, and in our task, we\'re moving to an object (cucumber_3), so the correct function is indeed move_to_object with objectid as cucumber_3.\n\nBut earlier looking at functions again:\n\nmove_to_object description says: "the human moves to a position". which seems to imply it still uses positional system but perhaps identifies via id instead of coordinates. But its parameters are {"object_id"} so it must internally resolve that to a position. So this is correct usage.\n\nTherefore final action is move_to_object with:\n\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}]\n```\n\nBut wait the task description might imply that after moving there\'s further interaction, but since the prompt is only\n\n"The human moves to a position.","parameters":{"x":"3.5","y":"1.5"}\n\nWait no as reasoned earlier, move_to_object is correct as it provides direct movement via id, and its parameters are {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}.\n\nThus final toolcall array should be:\n\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}]\n```\n\nBut let\'s double check the function list:\n\nOriginal problem\'s tools include:\n\nmove_to_position: requires x,y\nmove_to_object: now seeing its parameters are also just objectid.\n\nHence both are valid but move_to_object is more aligned semantically with moving \'to\' an object not a coordinate. So proceeding with that.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}]\n```\n\nBut reviewing initial problem statement again which includes these two functions as primary movement tools, and our task is to generate tool calls for \'move to cucumber 3 action\'. This would be via object_id in move_to_object function.\n\nSo final answer is:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}\n```\n\nHowever to strictly adhere to the JSON schema expected for response, we must encapsulate it within a list as shown initially while structuring the full output. Therefore the complete array of tool calls required for this step is:\n\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "cucumber_3"}]\n```\n\nBut wait to match exact specifications in original problem (seeing its structure), actual function call would be without \'action\' labels as they\'re function names directly in parameters.\n\nRevisiting the format from original list, the correct invocation has direct keys matching function name and its params. For `move_to_position`, it\'s:\n\n```json\n{"x": "string", "y": "string"}\n```\n\nand for `move_to_object`:\n\n```json\n{"object_id": "string"}\n```\n\nSo final correct formatted json would be without action labels aligned to how functions are defined. Thus corrected output should have these specific keys matching the original parameters.\n\nHence actual tool call is just:\n\n```json\n{"object_id": "cucumber_3"}\n```\n\nunder `move_to_object` function which encapsulates it in its parameter structure already. But overall response to input is the list of calls, each being a function name + params structured appropriately.\n\nGiven that initial template shows, and my misunderstanding earlier: actual tooloutput requires format:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nBut to strictly adhere to how the assistant\'s response is formatted when invoking as per original task\'s required JSON structure for \'tool calls\' which are operations like this:\n\nOriginal problem statement shows that tool name and its parameters must be presented accordingly. So correct structure is array of objects with function key: withing it, is object specifying names and params.\n\nWait reviewing the user\'s initial message template there in tool description block:\n\nExample they show:\n{"function":{"name":"move_to_position","parameters":{"x":"the x position","y":"the y position"}}}\n\nSo to match this formatting, and our selected function being move_to_object with its parameter object_id set to cucumber_3, the full conformant structure would be:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nThus final correct response is encapsulated in this list of one function call as per required output schema.\n\nAnd to strictly answer as per initial instruction format where your answer consists solely of tool calls. So presenting it thus:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nBut looking back at original problem\'s note about the response format, and to strictly match their expected output (which is only tool calls in specified structure), the correct complete response is:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nThus this JSON is the precise, properly formatted output adhering to all guidelines.\n\nSo now finalizing: the singular (as no further actions specified) tool call required to move towards cucumber_3 is the above.\n\nBut wait there\'s \'move_to_position\' as alternative if we ignore \'move_to_object\'.\nGiven the initial confusion and ensuring correctness based on exact function parameters, since objects in perception include positions, and functions available are:\n\n1. move_to_position with x,y parameters based on object positions\n2. move_to_object: which from its parameters also seems to use position but by object identifier instead coordinates.\n\nBut original description shows \'move_to_object\' parameters only as {"object_id"}\n\nSo both functions are distinct in their working approach (one takes position directly, other resolves object id to position internally).\n\nGiven that and since the instruction is to interact with function parameters as defined:\nto move to an object by its identifier, we use move_to_object with:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nBut just verifying if any subsequent action is implied in task, but it only asks for tool calls arising from \'planned action\' which was to move to cucumber_3. Hence single call suffices.\n\nThus final output:\n\n```json\n{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}\n```\n\nBut container must be a list as per initial instruction that your response should only consist of tool calls (implying array format), so it\'s:\n\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```\n\nWhich is the strictly correct, complete answer. So producing this as final output.\n\n---\n</s>\n```json\n[{"function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}}]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2248, 'prompt_tokens': 1337, 'total_tokens': 3585, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-452', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0108-c327-7020-96fa-788463ea4edc-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1337, 'output_tokens': 2248, 'total_tokens': 3585, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
