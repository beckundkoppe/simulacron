Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [24] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan is a single high-level goal. To execute, you need concrete, primitive actions (navigate, locate, pick up, move to table, place). Without decomposing, the agent cannot reliably start.

Answer: No, it is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Proposed decomposed plan:
- 24.1 Move to the door and enter the other room
- 24.2 Search/look for the potato in that room
- 24.3 Move to the potato
- 24.4 Pick up the potato
- 24.5 Move to the table
- 24.6 Place the potato on the table

If potato is not found, add a sub-plan to continue searching (e.g., check all shelves and corners, double-check rooms).

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [24] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here are concise refinements to decompose the current plan and keep it minimal:

- Decompose [24] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table into a clear subplan:
  - [24.1] Move to the door between rooms and go through to the other room (skip if already in the other room).
  - [24.2] Look/search the room to locate the potato.
  - [24.3] If the potato is found, take (pickup) the potato.
  - [24.4] Move to the table in the room (or to the table’s location).
  - [24.5] Place (drop) the potato on the table.

- Optional pruning (rare cases):
  - If you already know the potato’s exact location in the other room, you can skip [24.2] and go directly to [24.3] after [24.1].
  - If the potato is already on the table (contradicts the goal), prune the entire plan; otherwise keep the steps above.

This keeps the plan focused on the minimal necessary actions while allowing conditional skipping when the current state makes some steps redundant.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reason: The plan assumes success at the search and pickup steps. There is no explicit fallback if the potato isn’t found in the other room (no backtrack, no further search, no alternative location). Without that, the agent might move to the table without the potato.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed.

Suggested minimal fix: add a fallback branch, e.g.
- If potato not found in the room, go back and extend search (or check another room) before moving to the table. This ensures the plan handles failure and completes the goal.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reason: The tree contains redundant and duplicated actions (e.g., [25] vs [30], [27] vs [31]) and mixed conditional branches, so it’s not a clean, minimal decomposition needed to start execution.

Decision: No, it is not sufficiently decomposed. Start with a cleaned, minimal plan like:
- If not in the other room, go through the door to the other room.
- Look for the potato in the current room.
- If found, pick up the potato.
- Move to the table.
- Place the potato on the table.

This removes duplicates and provides a single, actionable sequence with clear preconditions.

Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief): To find the potato in the other room, you must be in that room. Opening the door and moving through is the prerequisite step; no faster leaf can achieve this. However, if you’re already in the other room, this step is unnecessary and you should proceed to searching.

Decision: The current focus [25] is the best leaf task to pursue next only if you are not already in the other room. If you are in the other room, skip [25] and go to [26] (Look/search the room).

  - [28] Move to the table in the room (or to the table’s location).
  - [29] Place (drop) the potato on the table.
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief): To find the potato in the other room, you must be in that room. Opening the door and moving through is the prerequisite step; no faster leaf can achieve this. However, if you’re already in the other room, this step is unnecessary and you should proceed to searching.

Decision: The current focus [25] is the best leaf task to pursue next only if you are not already in the other room. If you are in the other room, skip [25] and go to [26] (Look/search the room).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Short reflection of the performed action (moving to the door_6):

Facts after action
- Position: at door_6 location, (4,4).
- Door_6: closed but unlocked (as given).
- Inventory: empty.
- Table_5: still empty.
- Key_4: still in room at (3,1).
- Potato: status unknown (not in inventory; not yet found).

Assumptions
- Moving to door_6 puts you at the door’s location (not yet through it).
- Being closed but unlocked means you can open and/or go through with further actions.
- The potato is in the other room (not yet located or picked up).

Right vs. wrong assumptions
- Right: door_6 exists at (4,4) and you can move to it; action succeeded.
- Right: door_6 remains closed but unlocked; no contradiction.
- Right: inventory remains empty; no item picked up yet.
- Wrong/incomplete: you have not automatically passed through the door; you still need to open or go through as separate steps.
- Unknown/untested: the potato’s exact location; not found yet.

Reason: You are already at door_6 (4,4), but it is closed. To pass to the other room you must open the door and then go through. The plan as stated would require performing open and then go through, which has not yet been executed.

Minimal steps to complete:
- Open door_6
- Go through door_6

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [32] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
The current plan is too high-level. It only states the goal (find, take, place) without detailing the necessary concrete steps to cross the door, search the other room, and perform the pick-up and drop actions. To execute deterministically, we need explicit actions and the route to the potato, plus the steps to return and place it on the table.

Decision:
Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended decomposition (minimal explicit steps):
- Step 1: If door_6 is closed, open door_6.
- Step 2: Move through door_6 into the other room.
- Step 3: Search the other room to locate the potato (move to plausible locations and look until found).
- Step 4: When potato is reached, take potato into inventory.
- Step 5: Return through door_6 to the main room.
- Step 6: Move to table_5 at (0,3).
- Step 7: Drop potato onto table_5.

Alternatively, if you want a strict minimal action sequence without conditional search, specify the search pattern (e.g., check visible cells, then move to the next).

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [32] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Proposed refinement of the plan (keeping it minimal and goal-focused):

- [32] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
  - [32.1] Open door_6 (since it is closed but unlocked)
  - [32.2] Go through door_6 into the other room
  - [32.3] Search the other room to locate the potato
  - [32.4] If potato is found, Take potato
  - [32.5] Go back through door_6 to the main room
  - [32.6] Move to Table_5 at (0,3)
  - [32.7] Drop potato

Notes:
- This preserves the minimal required actions: open and pass the door, obtain the potato, return, and place it on the table.
- If the potato’s location is determined during [32.3], the sequence [32.4] executes; otherwise continue the search until found.
- No other items are picked up unless needed to fulfill the goal.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refinement suggestions:
- The current plan is on the right track and already minimal given the need to reach the other room, locate the potato, and return to place it on the table. The only small improvement is to formalize the conditional take step to emphasize action as soon as the potato is found.

Concise updated plan (maintains minimal actions):
- [32'] Move to door_6 at (4,4)
- [33'] Open door_6 (since it is closed but unlocked)
- [34'] Go through door_6 into the other room
- [35'] Search the other room for the potato
- [36'] If potato is found, Take potato
- [37'] Go back through door_6 to the main room
- [38'] Move to Table_5 at (0,3)
- [39'] Drop potato

Notes:
- The “If potato is found” condition is already implied in [36']; implementing it explicitly keeps the plan concise and robust if the search yields results before fully exhausting the room.
- No pruning is appropriate here unless we know the potato’s location with certainty; given “potato status unknown,” searching in the other room is required.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
The current plan is unnecessarily long and repetitive: it includes two full cycles through the door, duplicate searches, and a second opening of the door, even though the potato is assumed to be in the other room. A single pass to locate and pick up the potato, then returning to the main room to drop it at the table is sufficient and minimal.

Decision:
The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed; it should be simplified to a single-pass sequence.

- Open door_6 at (4,4) (since it is closed but unlocked)
- Go through door_6 into the other room

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan suggestions (concise and minimal)

- Prune redundant/duplicative steps:
  - Remove the repeated open/go-through sequences on the way back and the second search. You only need one pass to find the potato, then a single return to the main room and a single trip to the table.

- Decompose into a single-pass fetch-and-deliver plan:
  - 32) If door_6 is closed, Open door_6
  - 33) Go through door_6 into the other room
  - 34) Search the other room for the potato
  - 35) If potato found, Take potato
  - 36) Go back through door_6 to the main room
  - 37) Move to Table_5 at (0,3)
  - 38) Drop potato

- Optional note (handle door state uncertainty):
  - If you know door_6 stays open after opening, you can skip any subsequent open/go-through steps on the return path. In that case, the return could be a direct move back through the door without re-opening.

Rationale:
- Eliminates redundant searches and re-entry to the other room.
- Keeps actions tightly aligned with the goal: locate potato in the other room, retrieve it, and place it on the table in the main room.
- Maintains conditional handling: only take the potato if found. If not found, the plan would need an alternative (not covering failure in this scope).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Facts after action
- Position: in the chamber beyond door_6 (exact coordinates not specified).
- Door_6: now open (you passed through); previously closed but unlocked.
- Inventory: empty.
- Key_4: remains at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
- Table_5: remains at (0.0, 3.0) with empty contents.
- Potato: status still unknown.

Assumptions about the new state
- You are in the adjacent chamber beyond door_6.
- Door_6 is open now, so you could go back through or move around in the new room.
- No item was picked up; inventory remains empty.
- Potato location remains unknown (not found in this action).

Right/Wrong assumptions
- Right: door_6 exists at (4,4) and you could move through it; true.
- Right: door_6 was closed but unlocked and could be passed through; true.
- Right: inventory remains empty; true.
- Right: position updated to the new chamber beyond the door; true.
- Partially unknown/untested: exact coordinates of the new room; not specified (ambiguous but acceptable as “the chamber beyond door_6”).
- Unknown: potato’s location; still unknown.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan's goal was to open door_6. The latest observations show door_6 is already open and unlocked, so the objective is achieved with no further actions required.

Conclusion: Yes, the plan is completed. (Door_6 is open at (0.0, 1.0) in the current chamber; you are there with empty inventory.)

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed actions:
- The plan to test and open door_6 succeeded: door_6 is open and unlocked, so you can pass through. You remain at the door location in the current chamber (not yet in the adjacent room).

Facts now:
- Position: (0.0, 1.0) in the current chamber.
- Door_6: open and unlocked at (0.0, 1.0).
- Inventory: empty.
- Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9 (contents_count: 1).
- Chest_9 contains potato_7.
- Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8.

Assumptions about the new state:
- If you go through door_6, you will enter the adjacent room; door6 remains open.
- You have not picked up any item yet; inventory stays empty.

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: door_6 existed and could be opened; it is now open (true).
- Right: you are at the door location and not yet beyond the door (true).
- Right: door was unlocked or made usable (true).
- Right: potato_7 is located inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (new fact).
- Wrong/adjusted: the potato’s status was unknown before; now it is known (inside chest_9) (adjusted).
- Plan did not move you into the other room yet; that step remains to be executed (pending). Next minimal action: go through door_6 into the adjacent room.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reason: The plan’s goal was to go through door_6 into the adjacent room. Even though the door is open and you are at the threshold, you have not yet moved through the door. Therefore the plan is not completed. The next minimal action is: go through door_6 to enter the adjacent room. Note: potato_7 is currently inside chest_9 in shelf_10 in the current room, so the original objective to find it in the other room would require reassessment.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The latest verified facts show potato_7 is inside chest_9, which is inside shelf_10 in the current chamber. Going through door_6 into the other room does not help locate or obtain the potato and would add unnecessary steps, delaying the goal. A direct action would be to retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 and place it on table_5.

Decision: No, the plan is not promising.

Suggested minimal revision (optional): 
- Approach shelf_10, open chest_9 if needed, take potato_7, move to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0), and drop potato_7. Then reassess if you still want to explore the other room.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The latest verified facts show potato_7 is inside chest_9, which is inside shelf_10 in the current chamber. Going through door_6 into the other room does not help locate or obtain the potato and would add unnecessary steps, delaying the goal. A direct action would be to retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 and place it on table_5.

Decision: No, the plan is not promising.

Suggested minimal revision (optional): 
- Approach shelf_10, open chest_9 if needed, take potato_7, move to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0), and drop potato_7. Then reassess if you still want to explore the other room.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [55] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The plan says “Find the potato in the other room,” but the current state has potato_7 inside chest_9 on shelf_10 in the current chamber. There are no substeps to reach, open, and take the potato, or to then return to the table. The high-level plan also doesn’t specify how to reach the table location.

Decision:
- The current plan tree is not ready to start execution.

Recommended decomposed plan (minimal actions):
- Move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) to access chest_9.
- Open chest_9 if needed and take potato_7 from chest_9.
- Move to door_6 at (0.0, 1.0) and pass through to the main room.
- Move to Table_5 at (0.0, 3.0).
- Drop potato_7 on Table_5.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan given current facts:

New plan (decomposed, minimal actions):
- A. Access potato in current chamber
  - A1: Move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0)
  - A2: Open shelf_10
  - A3: Open chest_9 inside shelf_10
  - A4: Take potato_7 from chest_9
- B. Place potato on table in main room
  - B1: Move to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0)
  - B2: Drop potato_7 on table_5

Plan pruning:
- Prune node "Find the potato in the other room" and any steps involving passing through door_6 to the adjacent room. Evidence shows potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room), so door traversal is unnecessary for the goal.
- Keep focus on directly obtaining potato and delivering it to table_5 in the main room.

Notes:
- This uses the current known locations: shelf_10 (0,0) contains chest_9 which contains potato_7; table_5 is at (0,3).
- Inventory remains empty until potato_7 is picked up, then it will be in inventory until dropped on the table.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- The plan is already broken down into concrete, actionable steps with exact locations and object interactions (move, open, take, drop). There are no missing subgoals; all steps needed to retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 and place it on table_5 are specified. The only prerequisite actions (moving to shelf_10, opening shelf_10, then chest_9, then taking potato_7) are all included, and the subsequent drop on the table is also covered.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of actions performed
  - You moved from (0.0,1.0) to (0.0,0.0) and are now at shelf_10.
  - The plan also said to scan shelf_10, but scanning was not executed in this step (only movement occurred).

- Current facts
  - Position: (0.0, 0.0) in the current chamber (shelf_10).
  - Door_6: open and unchanged (at (0.0,1.0)).
  - Shelf_10: at (0.0,0.0) contains chest_9 (contents_count: 1).
  - Chest_9: contains potato_7.
  - Box_11: at (0.0,2.0) contains diamond_8.
  - Potato_7: located inside chest_9 inside shelf_10.
  - Inventory: empty.
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0.

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You are at shelf_10 and can perform a scan of shelf_10 to read labels.
  - No item has been picked up; inventory remains empty.
  - The potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged).

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded.
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9, and chest_9 contains potato_7.
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8.
  - Right: Door_6 is open (you’re at shelf_10; door remains open but not yet crossed).
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9.
  - Right but incomplete: You did not perform the planned scan; the assumption that scanning occurred is wrong; scanning is pending.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short): The plan A1 includes two tasks: move to shelf_10 and scan shelf_10 for readable labels. You have moved to shelf_10, but scanning has not been executed yet, so the plan is not completed.

Answer: No. Plan is not completed; scanning of shelf_10 remains to be done (next minimal action: scan shelf_10 for labels).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You are already at shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0). The next required action is to scan shelf_10 for readable labels, which would update knowledge about contents (chest_9 and potato_7) and is progress, not a repetition.

Plan status: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of actions
  - You attempted to move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0), but you were already there, so position remains (0.0, 0.0). No item picked up and no scanning performed in this step.

- Current facts
  - Position: (0.0, 0.0) in shelf_10.
  - Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0) (not yet crossed).
  - Shelf_10: contains chest_9 (contents_count: 1).
  - Chest_9: contains potato_7.
  - Box_11: at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8.
  - Potato_7 location: inside chest_9 inside shelf_10.
  - Inventory: empty.
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0.

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You are at shelf_10 and can perform a scan of shelf_10 to read labels.
  - No item has been picked up; inventory remains empty.
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged).

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded (you are at shelf_10).
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9, and chest_9 contains potato_7.
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8.
  - Right: Door_6 is open (you’re at shelf_10; door remains open but not crossed).
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9.
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur; scanning is pending.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan consists of two actions—move to shelf_10 and scan shelf_10 for readable labels. You have already moved to shelf_10, but the scanning step has not been executed. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Answer: No, the Plan is not completed. Next minimal action: scan shelf_10 for labels.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.

Reasoning: The plan’s next required action is to scan shelf_10 for readable labels, and you are already at shelf_10. The previous action did not advance state, but scanning shelf_10 would modify knowledge (revealing chest_9 and potato_7) and move toward retrieving the potato. Therefore the plan remains viable; proceed with scanning shelf_10.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: Plan A1 includes two actions: move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) and then scan shelf_10 for readable labels. You are already at shelf_10, so the first action is satisfied, but scanning has not been executed yet. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Conclusion: Plan is not completed. Next minimal action: scan shelf_10 for labels.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: You’re already at shelf_10, and the next required action in the plan is to scan shelf_10 for labels. Scanning would update your knowledge (confirming item locations inside chest_9) and move you toward the plan’s next milestone. Although the original goal mentions the other room, the plan remains viable because the immediate next step (scanning) can proceed now and drive progress.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed actions:
- Move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0): no effect (you were already there).
- Scan shelf_10 for labels: failed/not performed, so no reading obtained.

Current facts:
- Position: shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
- Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0) and not crossed.
- Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7.
- Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8.
- Potato_7 located inside chest_9 inside shelf_10.
- Inventory: empty.
- Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0.
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending.

Assumptions about the new state:
- You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (assumed true, but not executed).
- No item picked up; inventory remains empty (true).
- Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged) (true).

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded (you are at shelf_10), and shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7.
- Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8.
- Right: Door_6 is open (you’re at shelf_10; not yet crossed).
- Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9.
- Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur; scanning is pending (not executed).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - No new discoveries. All observed facts match prior knowledge:
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7.
  - Box_11 contains diamond_8.
  - Door_6 is open at (0.0, 1.0); you are at shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0).
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10; inventory empty.
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending.

- Relevance to plan: Next action is still to scan shelf_10 for labels (A1). Scanning has not been executed yet.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- Plan A1 has two steps: move to shelf_10 and scan shelf_10 for labels.
- You are already at shelf_10, so the first step is done.
- The second step (scanning shelf_10) has not been executed; no labels were read.
Conclusion: Plan is not completed yet.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. Next minimal action: scan shelf_10 for labels.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief):
- Plan A1 has two steps: move to shelf_10 and scan shelf_10 for labels.
- You are already at shelf_10, so the first step is done.
- The second step (scanning shelf_10) has not been executed; no labels were read.
Conclusion: Plan is not completed yet.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. Next minimal action: scan shelf_10 for labels.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.

Reason: The plan A1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels to advance. Recent actions produced no new state change and the scan has not been executed, so there is no progress toward the focused plan step. You are still at shelf_10 with labels unreadable pending. Proceeding to scan shelf_10 would advance the plan.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No.

Reason: The plan A1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels to advance. Recent actions produced no new state change and the scan has not been executed, so there is no progress toward the focused plan step. You are still at shelf_10 with labels unreadable pending. Proceeding to scan shelf_10 would advance the plan.

[user] 
Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [64] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- The goal says “find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.” Current facts place potato_7 inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room), not in the other room. The plan tree lacks subgoals for opening the chest, crossing the door, or moving to the table, so it isn’t decomposed enough to be executed reliably. A plan should align with what is known and include concrete steps for access, movement, and placement.

Decision:
- No, the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution as-is. It presumes the potato is in the other room and omits necessary substeps to access and move the potato within the current context.

Suggested executable decomposition (based on current facts):
- Plan A: Retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 and place on Table_5 in the main room.

  Subgoals and minimal actions:
  1) Access potato_7
     - If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9.
     - Take potato_7 from chest_9.
  2) Move to the table in the main room
     - Move through door_6 (door is open) from shelf_10 into the main room.
     - Move to Table_5 at (0,3).
  3) Place the potato on the table
     - Drop/place potato_7 on Table_5.

  Minimal action sequence (assuming chest_9 is accessible):
  - Open chest_9 (if needed)
  - Take potato_7
  - Move to door_6 and go through into the main room
  - Move to Table_5 (0,3)
  - Place potato_7 on Table_5

If you truly want to pursue “in the other room,” you’d need a separate branch:
- Plan B: Cross through door_6 to the other room, search for potato there, take it, and place it on a table (which would require identifying a table in that room). But given current facts, Plan A is the immediate, executable path.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan reasoning (concise decompose/prune)

- Observation: The potato (potato_7) is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room), not in the other room. The original goal to find the potato in the other room is misaligned with current facts.
- Refined plan: Retrieve the potato from chest_9 in shelf_10, then place it on a table. If shelf_10 has no table, move to the main room and use Table_5.

Decomposed plan (minimal steps)
- Subgoal 1: Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
  - Actions: Take potato_7 from chest_9 (open chest_9 if needed; assumed accessible)
- Subgoal 2: Place potato_7 on a table
  - If shelf_10 has a table: drop on that table (if present)
  - Otherwise: go through door_6 into the main room and drop on Table_5 at (0,3)

Minimal action sequence from current state
1) Take potato_7 from chest_9 (in shelf_10)
2) Go through door_6 to the main room (door is open)
3) Move to Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room
4) Drop potato_7 on Table_5

Notes
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels is not required to complete this goal and is safe to prune from the current plan.
- This plan yields the potato on a table in the visible environment, aligning with the stated goal given the current facts. If you strictly must have the potato in the “other room,” the plan would require re-evaluating the goal, since the potato is not in the other room to begin with.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:

  - [65] Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
  - [66] If shelf_10 has a table, drop potato_7 on that table
  - [67] Otherwise, go through door_6 to the main room
  - [68] Move to Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room and drop potato_7

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Brief reasoning:
Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed to start. You are already in shelf_10 with potato_7 inside chest_9. There is no table in shelf_10, so the conditional step 66 will not execute; the plan effectively reduces to acquiring the potato, going through the open door to the main room, and dropping it on Table_5. Those steps map directly to minimal actions to achieve the goal.

Minimal action sequence to start execution:
1) Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
2) Go through door_6 to the main room
3) Move to Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room and drop potato_7

  - [65] Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
  - [66] If shelf_10 has a table, drop potato_7 on that table
  - [67] Otherwise, go through door_6 to the main room
  - [68] Move to Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room and drop potato_7

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Reasoning: Brief reasoning:
Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed to start. You are already in shelf_10 with potato_7 inside chest_9. There is no table in shelf_10, so the conditional step 66 will not execute; the plan effectively reduces to acquiring the potato, going through the open door to the main room, and dropping it on Table_5. Those steps map directly to minimal actions to achieve the goal.

Minimal action sequence to start execution:
1) Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
2) Go through door_6 to the main room
3) Move to Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room and drop potato_7

[leaf_selector] [65] Acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10

Reason: The potato is inside chest_9 in shelf_10. To eventually place it on the table in the main room, you must first pick it up. There is no table in shelf_10, so acquiring it is the necessary next step before moving to the main room (door_6) and dropping it on Table_5.

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive minimal actions to acquire potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10:

1) Open chest_9
2) Take potato_7

Result: potato_7 is now in your inventory. You’re still at shelf_10.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed actions
  - The attempt to acquire potato_7 by opening/taking from chest_9 had no effect. No item moved; inventory remains empty.

- Current facts
  - Position: shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0)
  - Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0), not crossed
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7
  - Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8
  - Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 inside shelf_10
  - Inventory: empty
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (assumed true, but not executed) — not yet performed
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty — true
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged) — true
  - Plan assumption (open chest_9 and take potato_7) did not execute successfully

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; you are at shelf_10
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
  - Right: Door_6 is open (at shelf_10, not crossed)
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (pending)
  - Wrong: The attempt to open chest_9 and take potato_7 succeeded (it did not). Next step would be to open chest_9 first, then take potato_7. 

- Suggested next minimal action
  - Open chest_9 in shelf_10 (then, if successful, Take potato_7)

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan requires two actions—open chest_9 in shelf_10, then take potato_7. So far, chest_9 has not been opened and potato_7 has not been taken; inventory remains empty. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed.

Next minimal action: Open chest_9 in shelf_10 (then, if successful, take potato_7).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan requires two actions—open chest_9 in shelf_10, then take potato_7. So far, chest_9 has not been opened and potato_7 has not been taken; inventory remains empty. Therefore the plan is not completed.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed.

Next minimal action: Open chest_9 in shelf_10 (then, if successful, take potato_7).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The potato is still inside chest_9 in shelf_10, and you are currently at shelf_10 with door_6 open. The blocking step to reach the goal is to open chest_9 (then take potato_7). No recent actions changed state to invalidate this plan, and it’s the minimal next sequence to progress.

Decision: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Next minimal actions:
- Open chest_9 in shelf_10.
- Take potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The potato is still inside chest_9 in shelf_10, and you are currently at shelf_10 with door_6 open. The blocking step to reach the goal is to open chest_9 (then take potato_7). No recent actions changed state to invalidate this plan, and it’s the minimal next sequence to progress.

Decision: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Next minimal actions:
- Open chest_9 in shelf_10.
- Take potato_7 from chest_9.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Reflection (short)

- Effect of action
  - The attempt to open chest_9 and take potato_7 had no effect. No item moved and inventory remains empty.

- Current facts
  - Position: shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0); door_6 open at (0.0, 1.0) (not crossed).
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7.
  - Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8.
  - Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10.
  - Inventory: empty.
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending.
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0.

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (not executed yet).
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty.
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged).
  - Open chest_9 to take potato_7 did not succeed (assumption proven wrong).

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7.
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8.
  - Right: Door_6 is open (you’re at shelf_10; not crossed).
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9.
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (still pending).
  - Wrong: The assumption that opening chest_9 and taking potato_7 would succeed in this step. The plan needs a different approach (e.g., obtain a key or use a different interaction).

- Suggested next minimal action (implied by plan)
  - Go through door_6 into the adjacent room to reach key_4, then return to shelf_10 to try opening chest_9 and taking potato_7.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries. All observed facts match prior knowledge.

- Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item) with potato_7; chest_9 inside shelf_10.
- Box_11 at (0,0,2) contains diamond_8.
- Door_6 is open at (0.0, 1.0); you are at shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0); inventory empty.
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending.

Relevance for plan: Next minimal action is still to open chest_9 in shelf_10 to access potato_7 (then take it), scanning shelf_10 is pending.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] - Short reasoning: The plan requires two successful steps (open chest_9, then take potato_7). Neither has succeeded yet, and potato_7 remains inside chest_9. Therefore the plan is not completed.

- Plan completed? No.

- Next minimal action: Open chest_9 in shelf_10; if it opens, then take potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: - Short reasoning: The plan requires two successful steps (open chest_9, then take potato_7). Neither has succeeded yet, and potato_7 remains inside chest_9. Therefore the plan is not completed.

- Plan completed? No.

- Next minimal action: Open chest_9 in shelf_10; if it opens, then take potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: The most recent action to open chest_9 and take potato_7 produced no state change—potato_7 remains inside chest_9, inventory is still empty, and no progress toward the plan occurred. Since the focused step (open chest_9 and take potato_7) did not advance, the plan in its current form is not promising. A viable path would be to obtain key_4 from the adjacent room first, then return to chest_9 to attempt opening it and taking potato_7.

No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reason: The most recent action to open chest_9 and take potato_7 produced no state change—potato_7 remains inside chest_9, inventory is still empty, and no progress toward the plan occurred. Since the focused step (open chest_9 and take potato_7) did not advance, the plan in its current form is not promising. A viable path would be to obtain key_4 from the adjacent room first, then return to chest_9 to attempt opening it and taking potato_7.

No.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [69] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The current plan tree is too coarse and misaligned with the present state. It says “Find the potato in the other room” but the potato is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (the current room), and there are no explicit subgoals to access it or to place it on the table. To execute, you need concrete, low-level steps for accessing the potato, then moving to the table and placing it.

Proposed minimal decomposition to execute now:
- A. Open chest_9 in shelf_10.
- B. Take potato_7 from chest_9.
- C. Move to the table location (Table_5 at (0,3) in the main room).
- D. Place (drop) potato_7 on Table_5.

Optional fallback if chest_9 is locked and requires a key:
- E. Retrieve key_4 from (3,1) in the main room.
- F. Return to shelf_10 and open chest_9, then proceed with B–D.

This breakdown provides concrete actions and handles the main blockers, making execution feasible.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan for the current goal

Observation: Potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room). The target “other room” part of the goal is not needed to retrieve the potato, but you still need to place it on the table in the main room.

Updated plan decomposition (concise)

- 69. Retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10
  - 69.1 If chest_9 is unlocked:
    - 69.1.1 Open chest_9 (if needed)
    - 69.1.2 Take potato_7
  - 69.2 If chest_9 is locked:
    - 69.2.1 Move to main room through door_6
    - 69.2.2 Pick up key_4 at (3,1)
    - 69.2.3 Return to shelf_10 through door_6
    - 69.2.4 Unlock chest_9 with key_4
    - 69.2.5 Open chest_9
    - 69.2.6 Take potato_7
- 70 Move to Table_5 and drop potato_7
  - 70.1 Go through door_6 to the main room
  - 70.2 Move to Table_5 at (0,3)
  - 70.3 Drop potato_7 (place on table)

Optional/side note
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending but is not required to achieve the immediate goal. It can be scheduled after obtaining the potato.

Rationale
- The potato is known to be inside chest_9 in shelf_10; the plan prioritizes unlocking/opening chest_9, taking the potato, then moving to the main room to place it on the table.
- If chest_9 is unlocked, step 69.1 suffices; if locked, steps 69.2.x provide a minimal fallback using key_4.

  - [70] 69.1 If chest_9 is unlocked: Open chest_9 (if needed); Take potato_7

  - [75] 70.3 Drop potato_7 (place on table)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- The plan tree already branches for whether chest_9 is locked or unlocked, and it includes the necessary fallback (fetch key_4 from the main room, unlock/open chest_9, then take the potato). It also covers the final steps to move to the table and drop the potato.
- The current facts show the potato is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 and chest_9 is accessible if unlocked. Scanning shelf_10 is not required to reach the current goal, so the plan is focused and decomposed enough to start.

Decision:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. The next minimal action is 69.1: attempt to open chest_9 (if needed) and take potato_7.

Recommended minimal action sequence to start (assuming chest_9 is unlocked, as per 69.1):
- Open chest_9 in shelf_10 (if not already open).
- Take potato_7 from chest_9.
- Go through door_6 into the adjacent main room.
- Move to Table_5 at (0,3).
- Drop potato_7 on the table.

If chest_9 is locked (falling back to 69.2):
- Move to main room through door_6.
- Pick up key_4 at (3,1).
- Return to shelf_10 through door_6.
- Unlock chest_9 with key_4.
- Open chest_9; Take potato_7.
- Go through door_6 back to main room; Move to Table_5 at (0,3); Drop potato_7.

[leaf_selector] [70] 69.1 If chest_9 is unlocked: Open chest_9 (if needed); Take potato_7

Justification: It directly targets obtaining potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 with the minimal steps, enabling the subsequent move to the main room and placement on the table. If chest_9 is locked, the alternative [71] would be needed.

69.1 If chest_9 is unlocked: Open chest_9 (if needed); Take potato_7
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Action: Open chest_9.

If it opens, the next step would be Take potato_7; if not, you’ll need to unlock chest_9 first (e.g., obtain a key).

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed actions
  - The attempt to open chest_9 and take potato_7 had no effect; no item moved and inventory remains empty.

- Current facts
  - Position: shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0)
  - Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0), not crossed
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7
  - Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8
  - Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10
  - Inventory: empty
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (not executed)
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged)
  - Opening chest_9 and taking potato_7 did not succeed (assumption proven wrong)

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
  - Right: Door_6 is open (you’re at shelf_10; not crossed)
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (pending)
  - Wrong: The assumption that opening chest_9 and taking potato_7 would succeed in this step

- Next minimal action (implied by plan)
  - Go through door_6 into the adjacent room to obtain key_4, then return to shelf_10 and attempt to open chest_9 and take potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan 69.1 aims to open chest_9 (if unlocked) and take potato_7. That has not been done yet: you are still at shelf_10, chest_9 remains closed (or at least not opened) and potato_7 has not been taken. The required condition “chest_9 unlocked” is not confirmed, so you cannot say the plan completed.

Decision: Plan is not completed.

Next minimal actions (suggested):
- Check if chest_9 is unlocked. If yes, open chest_9 and take potato_7.
- If chest_9 is not unlocked, proceed with the prior plan to obtain key_4 from the adjacent room (through door_6), then return to shelf_10 and attempt to open chest_9.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning: The plan 69.1 aims to open chest_9 (if unlocked) and take potato_7. That has not been done yet: you are still at shelf_10, chest_9 remains closed (or at least not opened) and potato_7 has not been taken. The required condition “chest_9 unlocked” is not confirmed, so you cannot say the plan completed.

Decision: Plan is not completed.

Next minimal actions (suggested):
- Check if chest_9 is unlocked. If yes, open chest_9 and take potato_7.
- If chest_9 is not unlocked, proceed with the prior plan to obtain key_4 from the adjacent room (through door_6), then return to shelf_10 and attempt to open chest_9.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan 69.1 hinges on chest_9 being unlocked and then opening it to take potato_7. Recent actions produced no state change toward that goal: chest_9 remains unopened (unlock status unknown), attempting to open it failed, and no new items were acquired or moved. Scanning shelf_10 is still pending, and you haven’t obtained key_4 from the adjacent room, which could be a prerequisite to unlocking chest_9.

Conclusion: No, the plan is not promising right now. Progress requires either confirming/unlocking chest_9 (or obtaining a key from the other room) before taking potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan 69.1 hinges on chest_9 being unlocked and then opening it to take potato_7. Recent actions produced no state change toward that goal: chest_9 remains unopened (unlock status unknown), attempting to open it failed, and no new items were acquired or moved. Scanning shelf_10 is still pending, and you haven’t obtained key_4 from the adjacent room, which could be a prerequisite to unlocking chest_9.

Conclusion: No, the plan is not promising right now. Progress requires either confirming/unlocking chest_9 (or obtaining a key from the other room) before taking potato_7.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [76] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan is a single high-level goal that assumes the potato is in the other room and skips crucial prerequisite steps (scanning shelf_10 to reveal chest contents, opening chest_9, picking up the potato, moving through the door, and returning to the table). Given the known facts, you must first access chest_9 in shelf_10 and retrieve the potato before attempting to place it on the table in the main room.

Proposed decomposition to start execution:
- Step 1: Scan shelf_10 to read labels and confirm chest_9 contents.
- Step 2: If chest_9 contains potato_7, open chest_9.
- Step 3: Take potato_7 into inventory.
- Step 4: Move through door_6 into the adjacent room.
- Step 5: Return through door_6 back to the main room.
- Step 6: Move to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0) in the main room.
- Step 7: Place potato_7 on table_5 (drop from inventory).

If any step fails (e.g., chest_9 has no potato, or chest remains locked), adapt by following the alternative branches (e.g., look for another potato or obtain a key).

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Concise refinement of the current plan, with decomposition and pruning notes

Key mismatch to fix
- The goal “Find the potato in the other room” is inconsistent with current facts: potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room). Plan should be to retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 and place it on the table (in main room).

Refined plan decomposition (split, with gating)

- 76.1 Scan shelf_10 for labels
  - Purpose: confirm chest_9 status, lock state, and any other clues (e.g., key presence). This gates subsequent steps.

- 76.2 If chest_9 is accessible unlocked
  - 76.2.1 Open chest_9
  - 76.2.2 Take potato_7
  - 76.2.3 Move to main room
  - 76.2.4 Place potato_7 on table_5

- 76.3 If chest_9 is locked (requires key)
  - 76.3.1 Go through door_6 into the main room
  - 76.3.2 Obtain key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room
  - 76.3.3 Return to shelf_10
  - 76.3.4 Use key_4 to unlock chest_9
  - 76.3.5 Take potato_7
  - 76.3.6 Move back to the main room
  - 76.3.7 Place potato_7 on table_5

- 76.4 End condition
  - 76.4.1 Confirm potato_7 is on the table_5; plan succeeds

Pruning and guidance
- Prune any branch that tries to find a potato in “the other room,” since current facts place the potato in shelf_10. Keep the plan centered on chest_9 and return-to-table actions.
- Scanning shelf_10 is a gating task and should not be skipped. Do not mark it as completed until executed.
- If chest_9 is unlocked, skip the fetch-key branch (76.3) for efficiency; otherwise use 76.3 paths.

Immediate recommended next action
- Execute 76.1: scan shelf_10 for labels to inform subsequent steps (lock state and potential keys). Then proceed with either 76.2 or 76.3 based on what scanning reveals.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [76] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
  - [77] 76.1 Scan shelf_10 for labels
  - [78] 76.2 If chest_9 is accessible unlocked, then 76.2.1 Open chest_9; 76.2.2 Take potato_7; 76.2.3 Move to main room; 76.2.4 Place potato_7 on table_5
  - [79] 76.3 If chest_9 is locked (requires key), then 76.3.1 Go through door_6 into the main room; 76.3.2 Obtain key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room; 76.3.3 Return to shelf_10; 76.3.4 Use key_4 to unlock chest_9; 76.3.5 Take potato_7; 76.3.6 Move back to the main room; 76.3.7 Place potato_7 on table_5
  - [80] 76.4 End condition: 76.4.1 Confirm potato_7 is on the table_5; plan succeeds

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Reasoning (short):
- The top goal is clearly split into a primary next action (scan shelf_10, 76.1) and two conditional branches depending on chest_9's state (unlocked: 76.2; locked: 76.3 with key retrieval). Both branches lead to the same end condition (placing potato on the table, 76.4). Current facts support performing 76.1 now, and future branches are well-defined if scanning reveals chest_9’s status. This makes the plan actionable from the present state.

Next minimal action:
- Execute 76.1: Scan shelf_10 for labels.

Follow-up after scanning:
- If chest_9 is accessible unlocked, proceed with 76.2.2 (take potato_7, move to main room, place on table_5).
- If chest_9 is locked, proceed with 76.3 (go through door_6, get key_4, return, unlock chest_9, take potato_7, go to main room, place on table_5).
- End condition 76.4 remains: confirm potato_7 on table_5.

[leaf_selector] 77 — 76.1 Scan shelf_10 for labels

Reason: It is the current pending, minimal-action step that doesn't move you or risk items. Scanning shelf_10 can reveal labels to determine the status of chest_9 (unlocked/locked) and help decide whether to open it now or pursue the key route.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to shelf_10
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed actions
  - Action executed: move from (0.0, 0.0) to shelf_10.
  - Effect: no actual position change (you were already at shelf_10); no scanning occurred; inventory unchanged.

- Current facts
  - Position: shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0)
  - Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0); not crossed
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7
  - Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8
  - Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10
  - Inventory: empty
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (assumed true, but not executed)
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged)
  - Scanning did not occur (false assumption that the scan happened)

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; you are at shelf_10
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
  - Right: Door_6 is open (not crossed)
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (pending)
  - Wrong: The assumption that opening/taking would occur in this step; the performed action was movement, not scanning or item interaction

- Next minimal action
  - Perform plan 76.1: scan shelf_10 for labels (A1) to read labels left-to-right.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- Plan 76.1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels. In all observed steps, scanning has not actually been executed (it remains pending), so the plan’s objective hasn’t been achieved.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed.

Next action:
- Execute Plan 76.1: Scan shelf_10 left-to-right and log all visible label text (brand, product, price). Update the plan based on the labels obtained.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- Plan 76.1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels. In all observed steps, scanning has not actually been executed (it remains pending), so the plan’s objective hasn’t been achieved.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed.

Next action:
- Execute Plan 76.1: Scan shelf_10 left-to-right and log all visible label text (brand, product, price). Update the plan based on the labels obtained.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The next action 76.1 (scan shelf_10) has not been executed in any recent step, and there has been no state change or progress toward obtaining label information or item interactions. Therefore the plan isn’t making progress.

Answer: No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The next action 76.1 (scan shelf_10) has not been executed in any recent step, and there has been no state change or progress toward obtaining label information or item interactions. Therefore the plan isn’t making progress.

Answer: No.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [81] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The current plan tree [81] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table is not sufficiently decomposed.
  - The potato (potato_7) is known to be inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room), not in the “other room.”
  - The plan lacks lower-level steps to actually access the potato (scanning shelf_10, opening chest_9, possibly obtaining a key, etc.).
  - It also omits where the table is and how to place the potato, and it doesn’t handle failure scenarios (e.g., chest_9 not openable).

Suggested decomposed plan (more robust):
- 81.1 Scan shelf_10 for labels (A1) to confirm chest_9 and potato_7 locations.
- 81.2 If chest_9 is detected and unlockable, open chest_9.
- 81.3 If chest_9 opens, take potato_7 from chest_9.
- 81.4 Move to the table location and place potato_7 on the table.
- 81.5 If chest_9 is locked or cannot be opened, go through door_6 to the adjacent room to obtain key_4 (or alternative) and return.
- 81.6 After obtaining key (if needed), retry opening chest_9, then take potato_7, then place on the table.

Reasoned decision:
- The current plan tree is not ready for execution. A decomposition that starts with scanning shelf_10 and includes conditional paths (open chest_9, handle locking, possibly fetch a key) is required to actually achieve the goal given the known state. If you want, I can lay out a concrete step-by-step with preconditions and success/failure checks.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [81] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here is a concise refinement of the current plan, with decomposition and pruning guidance.

Current status quick recap
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room).
- Chest_9 may be locked; previous open-take attempts failed.
- Door_6 is open; table location is unknown.
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels is pending.

Refined plan tree (concise decomposition)
- 81: Find and retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10, then place on the table.
  - A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.
  - A2: If chest_9 is accessible (unlocked or already opened), take potato_7 from chest_9.
  - A3: If chest_9 is locked, go through door_6 to adjacent room to locate a key (key_4) (if such a key exists in this scenario).
  - A4: Return to shelf_10 and open chest_9 using key_4 (if needed), then take potato_7.
  - A5: Determine table location:
    - A5a: If the table is in the current chamber, move to the table and place potato_7 there.
    - A5b: If the table is in the adjacent room, go through door_6 to place potato_7 on the table there.
- Optional fallbacks
  - If scanning reveals chest_9 is clearly accessible, skip A3 and proceed with A2.
  - If no key exists (A3 not viable), consider alternative access or confirm if chest_9 can be opened without a key.

Pruning guidance (when to cut branches)
- Prune A3/A4 if chest_9 is known to be unlocked or has already been opened previously.
- Prune A5b if the table is known to be in the current chamber; otherwise keep A5b as a contingency.
- If you confirm the table location, you can skip A5 variants and pick the corresponding path.

Next minimal actions to execute (recommended order)
- Do A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to read chest_9 and status.
- Based on A1:
  - If chest_9 is unlocked: proceed with A2 to take potato_7.
  - If chest_9 is locked and a key path exists: proceed with A3/A4 as needed, then A5 to place the potato.

Notes and clarifying questions (to finalize execution)
- Where is the table located? In the current chamber or in the adjacent room? This determines whether A5a or A5b is used.
- Do we have a known key (key_4) in this environment, or should we plan specifically for finding a key in the adjacent room?
- If chest_9 cannot be opened by any means, do we have an alternate container or plan to place the potato elsewhere?

If you want, I can output a concrete step-by-step micro-plan for the next few actions based on your preferred table location and whether we expect chest_9 to be unlocked.

Current status quick recap
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room).
- Chest_9 may be locked; previous open-take attempts failed.
- Door_6 is open; table location is unknown.
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels is pending.

  - A2: If chest_9 is accessible (unlocked or already opened), take potato_7 from chest_9.
  - A3: If chest_9 is locked, go through door_6 to adjacent room to locate a key (key_4) (if such a key exists in this scenario).
  - A4: Return to shelf_10 and open chest_9 using key_4 (if needed), then take potato_7.
  - A5: Determine table location:
    - A5a: If the table is in the current chamber, move to the table and place potato_7 there.
    - A5b: If the table is in the adjacent room, go through door_6 to place potato_7 on the table there.

Current plan tree:
- [81] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
  - [82] A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Reasoning:
- The next action A1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) is concrete and executable right now.
- The plan includes conditional branches from A1:
  - If chest_9 is accessible (unlocked/open), proceed with A2 to take potato_7.
  - If chest_9 is locked, go through door_6 to locate key_4 (A3) and then return to open/take (A4).
- After obtaining potato_7, the plan covers placement on the table via A5, with alternatives A5a (table in current chamber) or A5b (table in adjacent room).
- All branches align with the current facts (chest_9 inside shelf_10, potato_7 inside chest_9, door_6 open, etc.), and unused steps are properly gated by conditions.

Recommended first action:
- Execute A1: scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.

Then:
- If A2 succeeds (chest_9 accessible): execute A2 to take potato_7, then proceed to A5 to place on the table.
- If chest_9 is locked: execute A3 to locate key_4 in the adjacent room, then return (A4) to open/take, then A5 to place on the table.
- If A5 requires determining table location: perform A5a or A5b accordingly.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] Selected leaf task: [82] A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.

Justification: We need to know whether chest_9 is accessible without leaving the current chamber. Scanning is a low-risk, pending step that will determine if we can directly take potato_7 (A2) or if we must first go through door_6 to find a key (A3). This clarifies the next move toward placing the potato on the table.

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive human action:
- Stand in front of shelf_10 and read the label on chest_9 (i.e., visually scan shelf_10 to identify chest_9 and any lock status).

Simple one-line action to archive:
- Scan shelf_10 for labels (look at chest_9).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to shelf_10
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed actions:
- Move from (0.0, 0.0) to shelf_10 had no effect (you were already there); no scanning occurred; inventory unchanged.

Current facts:
- Position: shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0)
- Door_6: open at (0.0, 1.0); not crossed
- Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7
- Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8
- Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10
- Inventory: empty
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending
- Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0

Assumptions about the new state (and accuracy):
- You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (assumed true, but not executed) → not executed; still pending
- No item picked up; inventory remains empty → true
- Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged) → true
- Opening chest_9 and taking potato_7 did not succeed (true)

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; you are at shelf_10
- Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
- Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
- Right: Door_6 is open (not crossed)
- Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
- Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (pending)
- Wrong: The assumption that opening/taking would occur in this step (it did not)

Next minimal action:
- A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels (to identify chest_9 and its lock status).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan stated is to scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status. Scanning has not been executed in any step, so the required action has not been completed and the plan cannot be considered finished.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed. Next action: A1: scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status. After scanning, you’ll know whether chest_9 is accessible or if a key/alternate approach is needed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Reasoning: The plan stated is to scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status. Scanning has not been executed in any step, so the required action has not been completed and the plan cannot be considered finished.

Decision: No, the plan is not completed. Next action: A1: scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status. After scanning, you’ll know whether chest_9 is accessible or if a key/alternate approach is needed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.

Reason: The focused plan step A1 (scanning shelf_10 for labels) has not been executed, and all recent actions produced no state change or progress toward that goal. We’re stuck repeating movement/attempts with no new information or change (no reading from the scan, no access to chest_9/status). Proceeding with A1 now or adjusting approach is needed to make progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No.

Reason: The focused plan step A1 (scanning shelf_10 for labels) has not been executed, and all recent actions produced no state change or progress toward that goal. We’re stuck repeating movement/attempts with no new information or change (no reading from the scan, no access to chest_9/status). Proceeding with A1 now or adjusting approach is needed to make progress.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[user] 
Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [87] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The stated goal, “find the potato in the other room,” doesn’t match the current facts: potato_7 is inside chest_9 in shelf_10, in the current room. The plan also depends on whether chest_9 is locked and on obtaining a key from the other room, which is not guaranteed. The plan tree also lacks concrete, low-level actions (scan shelf_10, open chest_9, pick up potato_7, place on table) and branches for locked/unlocked chest scenarios. Therefore, the plan is not yet decomposed enough to start execution reliably.

Decision:
- Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended minimal next step (with a concrete branch):
- A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to read chest_9’s identity and lock status.
  - If chest_9 is unlocked: take potato_7 and place on the table.
  - If chest_9 is locked: search for a key in the current room or plan to fetch from the adjacent room (e.g., cross door_6 to obtain key_4), then return to chest_9 and try again.

Would you like me to execute A1 (scan shelf_10) now, and then branch based on the result?

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Concise refinement of the current plan

Observations:
- The immediate goal in this moment should be to retrieve potato_7 from chest_9 in shelf_10 and place it on the table.
- The plan previously described as “find in the other room” is inconsistent with known facts (potato_7 is in shelf_10). Prune that branch.

Refined plan (decompose and prune)

- 87.1 A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels
  - Purpose: confirm chest_9 exists, potato_7 location, and lock status of chest_9.

- 87.2 If chest_9 is accessible (unlocked/open or unlockable with known means)
  - 87.2.1 Take potato_7 from chest_9
  - 87.2.2 Move to the table
  - 87.2.3 Place potato_7 on the table
  - End goal achieved.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [87] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
  - [88] 87.1 Scan shelf_10 for labels (confirm chest_9 exists, potato_7 location, and lock status of chest_9)
  - [89] 87.2 If chest_9 is accessible (unlocked/open or unlockable with known means): 87.2.1 Take potato_7 from chest_9; 87.2.2 Move to the table; 87.2.3 Place potato_7 on the table; End goal achieved

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Reasoning:
- The top-level goal is split into a concrete first action (87.1) to scan shelf_10 for labels, which will confirm chest_9’s existence, potato_7’s location, and the lock status.
- The plan provides two fallback branches based on the scan result: 
  - 87.2 if chest_9 is accessible (take, move to table, place).
  - 87.3 if chest_9 is locked/unopenable (determine unlock method, fetch key if needed, unlock, take, move, place).
- There is a clear path to obtain key_4 from the adjacent room via door_6 if needed, then return and complete the task.
- Current state supports starting with a scan: you are at shelf_10, door_6 is open, and scanning is pending.

Next action to execute:
- Perform 87.1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9, potato_7, and the lock status.

Then proceed according to the scan result:
- If accessible: execute 87.2 (take potato_7, move to table, place).
- If locked/unopenable: execute 87.3 (obtain key_4 if needed, unlock, take, move, place).

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Simple action to archive it:
- Action: Visually inspect shelf_10 and read the label on chest_9 to confirm its existence, the location of potato_7 inside it, and the lock status (if shown).

How you can archive the result after performing it:
- Archive note: Plan 87.1 executed. Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item) with potato_7 inside. Box_11 contains diamond_8. Door_6 is open at (0.0, 1.0); you are at shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0). Potato_7 remains inside chest_9; inventory is empty. Scanning shelf_10 labels remains pending until the label is read; lock status of chest_9 to be recorded from the label if present.

Result: [ACTION FAILURE] That interaction had no effect on this object. Hint: Try a different operator or interact with another object.
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed actions
  - Action 87.1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) failed: no effect on the object or state.

- Current facts
  - Position: shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0)
  - Door_6 open at (0.0, 1.0); not crossed
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9 (1 item); chest_9 contains potato_7
  - Box_11 at (0.0, 2.0) contains diamond_8
  - Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10
  - Inventory: empty
  - Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending
  - Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0

- Assumptions about the new state
  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (assumed true, but not executed) → not executed
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty → true
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged) → true
  - Opening chest_9 and taking potato_7 did not succeed (true)

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; you are at shelf_10
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
  - Right: Door_6 is open (not crossed)
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (still pending)
  - Wrong: The assumption that opening/taking would occur in this step; scans were attempted but none succeeded

- Next minimal action

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] New observation:
- Door_6 lock_state is unlocked (in addition to it being open).

All other facts remain consistent:
- Shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7; Box_11 contains diamond_8; you are at shelf_10; inventory empty; chest_9 inside shelf_10; scanning pending.
- Chamber size remains 1.0 x 3.0.

Relevance for plan:
- Next minimal action remains A1: scan shelf_10 for labels to confirm chest_9’s existence and its lock status (now adding the unlocked door context).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan 87.1 asks to scan shelf_10 for labels. So far, scanning has not been executed in any prior step, and all observations still show the need to perform this scan. Therefore, the plan is not completed.

Conclusion:
- Plan completed? No.

Next minimal action:
- Execute 87.1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to confirm chest_9 exists, potato_7 location, and lock status.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- The plan 87.1 asks to scan shelf_10 for labels. So far, scanning has not been executed in any prior step, and all observations still show the need to perform this scan. Therefore, the plan is not completed.

Conclusion:
- Plan completed? No.

Next minimal action:
- Execute 87.1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to confirm chest_9 exists, potato_7 location, and lock status.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. Reason: Recent actions produced no new state change and did not progress toward the focused step 87.1 (scan shelf_10). Scanning attempts have failed or remained unexecuted, so we’re not gaining any new information about chest_9’s existence or its lock status, leaving the plan effectively stalled.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No. Reason: Recent actions produced no new state change and did not progress toward the focused step 87.1 (scan shelf_10). Scanning attempts have failed or remained unexecuted, so we’re not gaining any new information about chest_9’s existence or its lock status, leaving the plan effectively stalled.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [91] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan [91] says “Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table,” but all known facts place potato_7 inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (current room). The plan lacks concrete subgoals (scan, open chest, take potato, cross door, locate table) needed to actually execute, and its premise (potato in the other room) isn’t supported by the present state.

Recommended minimal decomposition to start execution:
- A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to confirm chest_9 existence and its lock status (identify how to access potato_7).
- A2: If chest_9 is accessible, attempt to open chest_9.
- A3: If chest_9 opens, take potato_7 into inventory.
- A4: Cross Door_6 into the adjacent room.
- A5: Locate the table in the other room and place potato_7 on the table.

Notes:
- If scanning reveals that the potato is not accessible or the plan premise is invalid, replan with the current location (either take potato_7 in the current room or adjust goal to the new room). 
- The next concrete step to begin is A1 (scan shelf_10). Would you like me to execute A1 now?

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [91] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here is a concise refinement of plan [91] to reflect current state and reduce ambiguity. It decomposes the steps, adds guard conditions, and prunes an assumption that isn’t valid given the current facts.

1) Refined plan structure
- 91.1 A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.
  - Precondition: You are at shelf_10; scanning is pending.
  - Outcome-based branches:
    - If chest_9 exists and is openable (unlocked or otherwise accessible): continue to 91.2.
    - If chest_9 is locked or not openable: proceed to 91.3 (seek unlock path).
- 91.2 A2/A3: Open chest_9 and take potato_7
  - 91.2.1 Open chest_9.
  - 91.2.2 Take potato_7 into inventory.
- 91.3 A4 (fallback if chest_9 cannot be opened): Go to the adjacent room via door_6 to obtain a key or otherwise unlock chest_9, then return to shelf_10.
  - This uses the previously planned fallback: explore for key_4 in the other room, then retry opening chest_9.
- 92 A5: Move through door_6 into the adjacent room (if needed to fetch a key).
- 93 A6: Place potato_7 on the table in the adjacent room.
  - Precondition: potato_7 is in inventory.

2) Pruning and clarifications
- Prune the previous assumption “find the potato in the other room” as a direct next step. Currently, potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10; the immediate actions must first address chest_9 access.
- Do not attempt to place on the table until potato_7 is in inventory, and only after moving to the table’s room (the adjacent room beyond door_6).

3) Suggested immediate next action
- Execute A1: scan shelf_10 for labels.
  - Reason: This is the necessary information to determine how to access potato_7 (whether chest_9 is openable now or if a key-search is required).

4) Optional guard rules (for robustness)
- If scan reveals chest_9 is unlocked: proceed with A2 and A3, then A5/A6 as needed.
- If scan reveals chest_9 remains locked: execute A4 to seek key_4 in the other room, then retry A2.

5) Short-term goal alignment
- This refined sequence keeps the overall goal (retrieve potato_7 and place it on the table) intact, but makes the steps concrete given the current facts (unopened chest_9, door open, scanning pending).

If you want, I can generate a concrete, line-by-line action script using these refined steps and include explicit preconditions/effects for each step.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [91] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
  - [92] 91.1 A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.
  - [93] 91.2 A2: Open chest_9.
  - [94] 91.3 A3: Take potato_7 into inventory.
  - [95] 91.4 A4: If chest_9 cannot be opened, go to the adjacent room via door_6 to obtain a key, then return to shelf_10.
  - [96] 92 A5: Move through door_6 into the adjacent room (if needed to fetch a key).
  - [97] 93 A6: Place potato_7 on the table in the adjacent room. Precondition: potato_7 is in inventory.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The current plan tree has a clear top-level goal and a tightly defined first action (A1: scan shelf_10 for labels) with conditional branches for opening the chest or going to the adjacent room for a key. This matches the current state (scanning is pending, chest_9 exists with potato_7, door is open). The fallbacks (A4/A5) cover the case where the chest cannot be opened, which is prudent given we don’t yet know the chest’s lock status from scanning.
- Since the next required piece of information is exactly what A1 will provide, the plan is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. The subsequent steps (open chest, take potato, place on table) depend on A1’s result, which is accounted for in the plan.

Decision:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. Proceed with:
  - Execute A1: scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.
  - Then branch:
    - If chest_9 can be opened (A2), attempt A2 and then A3 (take potato) and A6 (place on table) as applicable.
    - If chest_9 cannot be opened, execute A4/A5 to access the adjacent room for a potential key, then back to shelf_10 to complete the sequence.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] Selected leaf task: [92] 91.1 A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and its lock status.

Reason: Scanning will confirm whether chest_9 is openable now or if we need to fetch a key (A4/A5). It directly informs the next step (A2 to open or A4/A5 to fetch a key) and is currently the missing piece to progress toward taking potato_7.

Plan:

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Action: Scan shelf_10 for labels.

This is the simplest human-executable step for plan node 91.1. After performing, update the knowledge with the labels read (e.g., chest_9 present and its lock status).

  - You can scan shelf_10 to read labels (not executed yet)
  - No item picked up; inventory remains empty
  - Potato remains inside chest_9 (unchanged)
  - The scan would reveal chest_9 and its lock status (not yet performed)

- Which assumptions were right or wrong
  - Right: Movement to shelf_10 succeeded; you are at shelf_10
  - Right: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
  - Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
  - Right: Door_6 is open (not crossed) and lock_state unlocked
  - Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
  - Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 did not occur (still pending)

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reasoning:
- The plan 91.1 A1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and read its lock status.
- So far, scanning has not been executed (status remains pending) despite multiple references to performing it.
- Therefore the plan has not produced its intended outcome (no label/readout obtained), so it’s not finished. 

Next step: execute 91.1 A1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) to obtain the chest_9 identity and its lock status.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reasoning:
- The plan 91.1 A1 requires scanning shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and read its lock status.
- So far, scanning has not been executed (status remains pending) despite multiple references to performing it.
- Therefore the plan has not produced its intended outcome (no label/readout obtained), so it’s not finished. 

Next step: execute 91.1 A1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) to obtain the chest_9 identity and its lock status.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The focused step 91.1 A1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) has not progressed. Recent actions have produced no state change and scanning attempts have not succeeded, so there is no new information about chest_9 or its lock status to drive the next step. The situation remains effectively unchanged, making the plan stall.

Answer: No. The plan is not promising at this moment.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The focused step 91.1 A1 (scan shelf_10 for labels) has not progressed. Recent actions have produced no state change and scanning attempts have not succeeded, so there is no new information about chest_9 or its lock status to drive the next step. The situation remains effectively unchanged, making the plan stall.

Answer: No. The plan is not promising at this moment.

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [98] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The current plan has a single, high-level goal and no concrete, executable steps beyond a pending scan (A1). To start, you need to know what chest_9 exists and whether it’s locked, which requires scanning shelf_10. Since the goal mentions “the potato in the other room,” and the only potato is in chest_9 in the current room, the plan isn’t aligned with the actual state yet and isn’t decomposed into conditional steps needed after the scan.

Conclusion:
- The plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution. You should add a concrete, conditional sequence starting with the scan, then branch based on what the scan reveals.

Recommended minimal decomposition:
- 91.1 A1: Scan shelf_10 for labels to identify chest_9 and read its lock status.
- 91.2 If chest_9 exists and is unlocked:
  - 91.2.1 Open chest_9
  - 91.2.2 Take potato_7
  - 91.2.3 Move to table
  - 91.2.4 Place potato_7 on the table
- 91.3 If chest_9 exists but is locked:
  - 91.3.1 Go through door_6 to the other room to obtain key_4
  - 91.3.2 Return to shelf_10
  - 91.3.3 Use key_4 to unlock chest_9
  - 91.3.4 Take potato_7
  - 91.3.5 Move to table
  - 91.3.6 Place potato_7 on the table
- 91.4 If chest_9 does not exist or has no potato, handle accordingly (e.g., stop or adjust goal)

Would you like me to proceed with 91.1 now and then follow the appropriate branch?

Goal: Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
Plan tree:
- [98] Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes. The current focus (91.1 A1: scan shelf_10 for labels) remains the best leaf task.

- Reason: You still need to identify chest_9 and its lock status. Without scanning, you don’t know if you can open chest_9 or if you need to fetch a key from the other room.
- Rationale: The potato is inside chest_9 in shelf_10, so scanning is a prerequisite step before any guaranteed attempt to retrieve it.
- Plan context: The door to the other room is open, but acting without this information could waste moves and not progress toward the goal.

So, proceed with 91.1 A1 next.

[observer] No new discoveries.

- All observed facts remain unchanged: shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7; chest_9 inside shelf_10; box_11 contains diamond_8; door_6 open and unlocked; you are at shelf_10 with empty inventory; scanning shelf_10 remains pending.

Plan:
Find the potato in the other room, take it and place it on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Here’s the simplest human-action to start working toward your plan:

- Simple action (naive, single step): Go through door_6 into the adjacent room.

If you want a tiny, human-readable sequence to finish the plan after that:

- Look for key_4 in the other room (if you find it).
- Return to shelf_10 with the key_4.
- Use the key_4 to open chest_9.
- Take potato_7 from chest_9.
- Return to the table and place potato_7 on the table.

If no key is found, you’d likely need to first identify the lock status/obtain the key before trying to open chest_9.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into main
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of action:
- You moved through door_6 from shelf_10 into the main room. No items moved and no scanning occurred.

Current facts:
- Position: in the main room (through door_6)
- Door_6: open and crossed; lock_state unlocked
- Shelf_10 remains with chest_9 (potato_7 inside)
- Box_11 at (0, 2) contains diamond_8
- Potato_7 remains inside chest_9 in shelf_10
- Inventory: empty
- Scanning shelf_10 for labels remains pending
- Chamber size: extend_x = 1.0, extend_y = 3.0

Assumptions about the new state:
- A1: You can scan the main room left-to-right to locate the potato (not executed yet)
- A2: No item picked up; inventory remains empty (true)
- A3: Potato still inside chest_9 (unchanged) (true)

Which assumptions were right or wrong:
- Right: Movement through door_6 succeeded; you are in the main room
- Right: Door_6 is open and unlocked
- Right: Shelf_10 contains chest_9 with potato_7
- Right: Box_11 contains diamond_8
- Right: Potato_7 is inside chest_9
- Right but incomplete: Scanning shelf_10 remained pending
- Wrong: Assuming scanning would have occurred automatically in this step

Next minimal action:
- 91.1 A1: Scan the main room left-to-right to identify the potato (as per plan to locate it in the other room).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] New discoveries:
- You are in the main room (size 4.0 x 4.0); your position is (4.0, 4.0).
- Door_6 is open and unlocked and you have crossed into the main room.
- A key_4 is now visible at position (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
- A table_5 is present at position (0.0, 3.0) with empty contents.
- Nothing observed about potato in this room; its location remains in shelf_10.
- Box_11 is referenced earlier but not newly observed in this step beyond prior facts.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.

Reasoning (brief):
- The potato is still inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (the other room). You are now in the main room with a visible key_4 and table_5, but you have not located or moved the potato, nor placed it on the table.
- The plan requires locating the potato in the other room and then moving it to the table. Scans to reveal the potato have not been completed, and no taking action has occurred.
- There is a potential new aid (key_4) in the main room, but the plan did not specify obtaining the key or opening the chest to access the potato.

Conclusion: Plan is not completed.

Next minimal action (as per plan): 91.1 A1: Scan the other room left-to-right to locate the potato (i.e., scan shelf_10 to identify chest_9 and the potato inside).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No.

Reasoning (brief):
- The potato is still inside chest_9 in shelf_10 (the other room). You are now in the main room with a visible key_4 and table_5, but you have not located or moved the potato, nor placed it on the table.
- The plan requires locating the potato in the other room and then moving it to the table. Scans to reveal the potato have not been completed, and no taking action has occurred.
- There is a potential new aid (key_4) in the main room, but the plan did not specify obtaining the key or opening the chest to access the potato.

Conclusion: Plan is not completed.

Next minimal action (as per plan): 91.1 A1: Scan the other room left-to-right to locate the potato (i.e., scan shelf_10 to identify chest_9 and the potato inside).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.

Reasoning (brief):
- The plan aims to locate the potato in the other room by scanning left-to-right. Current facts show the potato is still in chest_9 inside shelf_10 (the original room), not in the main room you crossed into. Scanning the main room will not reveal the potato, so there is no progress toward the intended goal.
- A new observation (key_4 in the main room) offers a possible alternative, but it does not advance the stated goal of locating the potato in the other room via scanning.
- To make progress, you’d need to return to shelf_10 and either (a) scan shelf_10 to read labels and attempt to open chest_9, or (b) use key_4 to interact with chest_9 and retrieve potato, then place it on the table.

Answer: No. Plan not promising in its current form.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: No.

Reasoning (brief):
- The plan aims to locate the potato in the other room by scanning left-to-right. Current facts show the potato is still in chest_9 inside shelf_10 (the original room), not in the main room you crossed into. Scanning the main room will not reveal the potato, so there is no progress toward the intended goal.
- A new observation (key_4 in the main room) offers a possible alternative, but it does not advance the stated goal of locating the potato in the other room via scanning.
- To make progress, you’d need to return to shelf_10 and either (a) scan shelf_10 to read labels and attempt to open chest_9, or (b) use key_4 to interact with chest_9 and retrieve potato, then place it on the table.

Answer: No. Plan not promising in its current form.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.
