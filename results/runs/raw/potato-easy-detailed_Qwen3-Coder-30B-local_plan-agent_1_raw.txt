[observer] I observe a key at position (3.0,1.0) and a door at (4.0,4.0) that is closed but unlocked. 

The key is relevant for my goal since it could be used to unlock the door to access the other room where the potato should be. The table in the main room is empty and not relevant to finding the potato.

I need to move to the key's position (3.0,1.0) to pick it up, then use it on the door (4.0,4.0) to enter the other room, and then search for the potato.

- Agent is now at position (3.0,1.0) where the key was located
- Key is within reach at this location

**Assumptions proved right:**

- Whether the key will successfully unlock the door at (4.0,4.0)
- Whether the other room contains the potato

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your goal? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] I observe the table at (0.0,3.0) is empty and ready to receive the potato. The door at (4.0,4.0) is open and unlocked, allowing access to the main room. I have the potato in my inventory and am currently positioned at (4.0,4.0) in the main room. The table is at (0.0,3.0) in the main room, which is where I need to place the potato. The key is also in my inventory but is no longer needed. The potato is the only item relevant to my goal.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to table at (0.0,3.0) and place the potato there.

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 4.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 4.0, "y": 4.0}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "key", "id": "key_4"}, {"name": "potato", "id": "potato_7"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_5", "position": "(0.0,3.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "door", "id": "door_6", "position": "(4.0,4.0)", "state": "open", "lock_state": "unlocked"}]} Reasoning: Move to table at (0.0,3.0) and place the potato there. Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
