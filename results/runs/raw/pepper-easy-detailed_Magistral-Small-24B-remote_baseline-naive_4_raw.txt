content='I need to collect all the peppers and place them on the table. First, I should move towards the nearest pepper. The peppers are at positions (3.5,1.0), (3.5,1.5), and (3.0,1.5). The table is at (3.5,0.5).\n\nI can start by moving to pick up one of the peppers. Since I\'m at position (0.0, 0.0), moving directly to one of these positions would be optimal.\n\nTo achieve this:\n1. Move to a pepper\'s position.\n2. Take the pepper from the floor.\n3. Repeat for all peppers.\n4. Finally, drop them on the table.\n\nBut that might not be the most efficient way as I\'d have to move around a lot. Alternatively, I could:\n\n1. Move close to the group of peppers\n2. Pick all the peppers in sequence\n3. Move to the table and drop all peppers\n\nBut since I can only take one object at a time (assuming), i need to pick them up one by one.\n\nSo steps would be:\n\n1. move to pepper_5 at position (3.5,1.0). Take it.\n2. move to pepper_4 at position (3.0,1.5) (since it\'s not aligned vertically with the others, might as well do this next). Take it.\n3. move to pepper_3 at position (3.5,1.5). Take it.\nBut wait- now i have all peppers in inventory. But how? The action description says "take_from" takes one item from another object and adds it to inventory. So I can carry multiple items.\n\nSo steps would be:\n- move to pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0), take it\n- move to pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5), take it\n- move to pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5), take it\nThen I have all peppers in inventory.\nNow I need to get to the table at (3.5, 0.5). So:\n- move to table at (3.5, 0.5)\nThen for each pepper, drop it onto the table.\n\nBut dropping multiple items onto a table: does "drop_to" require specifying which itemid? Looking at the description: "what_id (str): the id of the item A to be dropped." So I need to specify each pepper\'s id.\n\nSo the actions would be:\n- move to position near peppers or one by one.\nWait, maybe better to go to each pepper, take it, then drop on table. But that involves multiple moves back and forth which is inefficient.\n\nAlternative plan: collect all peppers first, then deposit them in one trip.\n\n1. Move to (3.5, 1.0), which is near pepper_5 and also quite close to the table at (3.5,0.5). From this position, I can reach:\n   - pepper_5 at (3.5,1.0) (same x-coordinate, just above)\n   - pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5) and pepper_3 at (3.5,1.5) are both y=1.5, which is higher up.\nBut since "move_to_position" allows specifying exact x,y position, I can choose a position nearby multiple peppers to minimize movement steps.\n\nLooking at the pepper positions:\n- pepper_5: (3.5, 1.0)\n- pepper_4: (3.0, 1.5)\n- pepper_3: (3.5, 1.5)\n\nThe table is at (3.5, 0.5). I\'m currently at (0.0,0.0).\n\nIf I move to (3.5, 1.2), that\'s between the peppers and closer to the table:\n- y=1.2 is between pepper_5 at y=1.0 and the others at y=1.5\n- x=3.5 is aligned with pepper_5 and pepper_3\npepper_4 is at (3.0,1.5) so I\'d have to move left for it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to go directly to each pepper sequentially and then to the table.\n\nBut in 2D space where movement is fluid, perhaps the optimal path is not strictly axis-aligned. But the API seems to expect discrete actions with specific tool calls.\n\nGiven that, here\'s a possible sequence:\n\n1. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=1.0) [position near pepper_5]\n2. take_from peanut_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR"\n3. move_to_position (x=3.0, y=1.5) [move to pepper_4]\n4. take_from peanut_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR"\n5. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=1.5) [move to pepper_3]\n6. take_from peanut_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR"  (but wait the position for pepper_3 is (3.5,1.5), so moving to that position directly after step 4 might be better)\nWait no: at step 4 I\'m already taking pepper_4 from FLOOR at its position (3.0,1.5). So to get to pepper_5 was at (3.5,1.0) already taken,\nthen moving to (3.0,1.5) for pepper_4, then from there to (3.5,1.5) for pepper_3.\n\nThen with all peppers in inventory:\n7. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=0.5)\n8a. drop_to what_id="pepper_5", to_id="table_6"\n8b. drop_to what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table_6"\n8c. drop_to what_id="pepper_3", to_id="table_6"\n\nBut: does "drop_to" require being nearby the target object (table in this case)? The description says: "Only use this, when you are nearby B." So before dropping, I must be near the table.\n\nSo step 7 moves me next to the table, then steps 8a-c drop each pepper onto it.\n\nBut is there a more efficient path? Maybe collect peppers in reverse order.\n\nAlternative sequence:\n1. move_to_position x=3.0, y=1.5 (near pepper_4)\n2. take_from what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR"\n3. move_to_position x=3.5, y=1.5 (now at pepper_3\'s location)\n4. take_from what_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR"\n5. move_to_position x=3.5, y=1.0 (now near pepper_5)\n6. take_from what_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR"\n7. move_to_position x=3.5, y=0.5 (near table)\n8. drop_to what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table_6"\n9. drop_to what_id="pepper_3", to_id="table_6"\n10. drop_to what_id="pepper_5", to_id="table_6"\n\nThis sequence involves moving directly from one pepper to the next in a path that covers all peppers before heading to the table.\n\nBut is this better than the first approach? In terms of number of steps, it\'s similar (9 and 7? Wait no, both are essentially 3 moves + drop operations). The total distance moved might differ slightly, but since movement is fluid in 2D space and we don\'t have distance metrics, both approaches seem viable and contain the same number of actions.\n\nPerhaps the first approach is more intuitive as it aligns with left-to-right ordering if we scan the positions from bottom to top (pepper_5 at y=1.0 up to pepper_3 at y=1.5).\n\nBut both achieve the goal in equal "cost" (number of function calls). For deterministic behavior, let\'s proceed with the first approach.\n\nFinal step-by-step plan:\n\n(Initial position: x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n1. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=1.0) - near pepper_5\n2. take_from what_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR"\n3. move_to_position (x=3.0, y=1.5) - near pepper_4\n4. take_from what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR"\n5. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=1.5) - near pepper_3\n6. take_from what_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR"\n7. move_to_position (x=3.5, y=0.5) - near table_6\n8. drop_to what_id="pepper_5", to_id="table_6"\n9. drop_to what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table_6"\n10. drop_to what_id="pepper_3", to_id="table_6"\n\nBut wait, the function descriptions mention "move_to_object" which might simplify some steps. Does it allow moving directly to an object by its ID rather than coordinates?\n\nLooking back at the tools:\n- move_to_position: move to specific x,y coordinates\n- move_to_object: move to position of an object specified by id\n\nUsing move_to_object would make more abstract commands:\n\nRevised plan using move_to_object:\n\n1. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_5")\n2. take_from what_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR"\n3. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_4")\n4. take_from what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR"\n5. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_3")\n6. take_from what_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR"\n7. move_to_object (object_id="table_6")\n8. drop_to what_id="pepper_5", to_id="table_6"\n9. drop_to what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table_6"\n10. drop_to what_id="pepper_3", to_id="table_6"\n\nThis seems cleaner as it abstracts away the positional calculations. The only difference is that move_to_object moves you adjacent to the object, which should satisfy the "nearby" requirement for take_from and drop_to actions.\n\nSo final action sequence will be using move_to_object:\n\n1. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_5")\n2. take_from what_id="pepper_5", from_id="FLOOR"\n3. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_4")\n4. take_from what_id="pepper_4", from_id="FLOOR"\n5. move_to_object (object_id="pepper_3")\n6. take_from what_id="pepper_3", from_id="FLOOR"\n7. move_to_object (object_id="table_6")\n8. drop_to what_id="pepper_5", to_id="table_6"\n9. drop_to what_id="pepper_4", to_id="table_6"\n10. drop_to what_id="pepper_3", to_id="table_6"\n\nBut the problem asks for "Give best next action". The entire sequence is needed, but if it\'s asking for just the first action, it would be:\n\nmove_to_object (object_id="pepper_5")\n\nBut more likely, we\'re to generate the full action sequence to complete the task.\n\nAssuming we need to provide the entire action sequence to collect all peppers and place them on the table, here are the toolcalls:' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2615, 'prompt_tokens': 1190, 'total_tokens': 3805, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-242', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019af751-07cb-7b02-888b-1669d9ef0489-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1190, 'output_tokens': 2615, 'total_tokens': 3805, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
