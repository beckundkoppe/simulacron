[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- **Human position**: now at (3.5, 1.0).  
- **Pepper_5**: still at (3.5, 1.0) (not yet picked up).  
- **Pepper_4**: remains at (3.0, 1.5).

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can move freely to the coordinates of pepper_5.  
2. Moving to pepper_5 does not alter the pepper’s location.  
3. The goal of “collect all peppers” has not yet been satisfied by this single move.

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong**

- Assumption 1: **Right** – the move succeeded.  
- Assumption 2: **Right** – pepper_5 remains at its spot.  
- Assumption 3: **Right** – the goal is still incomplete; we only reached the first pepper.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (pick_up pepper_3)**  

- **Human position**: (3.5, 1.5)  
- **Inventory**: pepper_5, pepper_4, pepper_3  
- **Pepper_3**: removed from the world (no longer at (3.5, 1.5))  
- **Pepper_4**: already removed (inventory)  
- **Pepper_5**: already removed (inventory)  
- **Table_6**: unchanged at (3.5, 0.5)  

**Facts now**

- Inventory contains all three peppers.  
- No peppers remain on the floor.  
- Table_6 is still empty.  
- Human is at (3.5, 1.5).  

**Assumptions made**

1. Picking up a pepper removes it from the world and stores it in the inventory.  
2. The human stays at the same coordinates after picking up.  
3. The action does not affect other objects (pepper_4, pepper_5, table_6).  

**Assumptions proved right**

- All three assumptions held true.
