content='I will first move the human towards the desired position and then perform other actions if necessary.\n\nBut for this task, the plan is clear: move to pepper_4 at (3, 1.5). So, the steps should be:\n\n1. Move to x=3.0 and y=1.5.\n2. Interact with object pepper_4.\nBut wait, the task says: "Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action." The planned action is only moving towards the object, not necessarily interacting with it.\n\nLooking back at the Task:\n"Task:\n            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.\n            Use correct object id.\n            Toolcall order matters.\n            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls."\n\nThe planned action is to move to pepper_4 at (3, 1.5). To achieve this, we need to perform one tool call "move_to_position" with x=3.0 and y=1.5.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again it says: "Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action." And the planned action is moving towards pepper_4 (position (3.0, 1.5), id pepper_4).\n\nI think the most accurate way to express this is by using move_to_position at the given coordinates.\n\nBut wait, there is another function available: "move_to_object" which takes an object_id. This might be more appropriate here.\n\nLet me check:\n\nTo move to the position (3.0, 1.5), where pepper_4 is located, we can use "move_to_object" with parameter object_id="pepper_4". But, does this function move the human directly to the object ? Yes it should, according to its description: "The human moves to a position." Wait no, looking again:\n\n"move_to_position" -  The human moves to a x,y position.\n"move_to_object" - The human moves to a position. But also is given by object_id.\n\nWait the descriptions are identical! I think there is a mistake here.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement:\n\nThe first function is "move_to_position" with parameters x and y (description: "the x position", "the y position") - this describes moving to an absolute coordinate.\nThe second function is "move_to_object" which has one parameter object_id, but its description is also "the human moves to a position."\nThis seems redundant or incorrectly described.\n\nMost likely the intention is that "move_to_position" is for absolute coordinates and "move_to_object" is for moving towards an object by specifying the object\'s id.\nBut the descriptions are identical and confusing. Maybe it\'s a copy-paste error in the description, but logically, having both functions available allows for more flexibility.\n\nGiven the task: to move to pepper_4 at (3, 1.5), using "move_to_object" with object_id="pepper_4" seems most appropriate, as it directly specifies the target (the object) rather than its position.\nBut if we use coordinates, "move_to_position" would also work.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in descriptions, but the intention is to move towards object pepper_4, using "move_to_object" with object_id="pepper_4" seems more aligned with the task.\n\nSo the action plan would be to call this function once with pepper_4 as the object_id.\n\nBut let\'s also consider if any other actions are needed.\nThe task only asks for moving towards pepper_4, no interaction or pickup is required here. So one toolcall should suffice:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_4"}\n```\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s see if any other steps are necessary.\n\nLooking at the initial state:\n- Human position: (0.0, 0.0)\n- Object pepper_4 is at (3.0, 1.5)\n\nNo obstacles or other objects in between. So moving directly there should work with one call to move_to_object with object_id="pepper_4".\n\nBut wait, the first function\'s description might have been intended to be different. Maybe "move_to_position" is for moving relative to current position? But the parameter is \'x\' and \'y\', which usually denotes absolute coordinates in such problems.\n\nGiven that, and without further context, using move_to_object with pepper_4 seems most straightforward for this task.\n\nBut let\'s cross-validate:\n\nIf we interpret "move_to_position" as moving to an absolute position (x,y) coordinate and "move_to_object" is not functional or misleadingly described (same description), then the correct approach would be to calculate the path to (3.0,1.5).\n\nGiven that human starts at (0,0), we\'d call move_to_position with x=3.0, y=1.5.\n\nBut the task mentions "planned action is moving towards pepper_4", which might imply using move_to_object, but its description is unclear.\n\nGiven ambiguity in descriptions but clear that the task wants to move towards object pepper_4 located at (3,1.5), and assuming functionality aligns with typical use cases: move_to_object would be preferable as it abstracts away coordinate management from us.\n\nBut if I had to choose based on names alone:\nmove_to_position: by coordinates\nmove_to_object: by object reference\n\nSo for this task, using object_id seems more appropriate, even if descriptions are unclear. So proceed with:\n\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_object",\n  "object_id": "pepper_4"\n}\n```\n\nBut let me think again about the ambiguity. Maybe move_to_position is the correct one because we know exact coordinates (3, 1.5) for pepper_4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both functions are intended to do the same thing, but with different parameters. In that case either would work.\nGiven that in the initial state, we have the position of pepper_4 as (3,1.5), and no other constraints mentioned, using move_to_position with those coordinates is unambiguous.\n\nSo final plan:\n1. Call move_to_position(x=3.0, y=1.5) to reach the position of pepper_4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: "the planned action is moving towards pepper_4 at (3, 1.5)" - which suggests that the action is defined by the object and its location, not just reaching coordinates.\nSo perhaps move_to_object is indeed intended for this: referring to the object by id and letting the system know how to get there based on its known position.\n\nGiven that, in absence of more context, I\'d proceed with move_to_object with pepper_4\'s id.\n\nFinal decision: use move_to_object with object_id="pepper_4".\n\nBut to ensure correctness let me think about the alternative:\n\nIf we consider that the room is of size extend_x=4.0 and extend_y=2.0, starting at (0,0), moving to (3,1.5) is valid as 3 <= 4 and 1.5 <= 2.\n\nNo obstacles or other objects mentioned in perception that could block path.\nHuman inventory is empty so no weight concerns etc.\n\nThus one action suffices.\n\nBut what if move_to_object requires the system to know where pepper_4 is, which it does from our_perception (it\'s at (3.5,1.5) - wait no:\nour_perception shows pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5).\n\nSo data matches between task and initial state.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_4"}\n```\n\nWait but the problem statement says pepper_4 is at (3.0, 1.5) in the perception list, which matches the task\'s target position.\nBut earlier I thought it was at (3.5,1.5) - no looking back:\n\nInitial state shows:\npepper_4: id="pepper_4", position "(3.0,1.5)"\ntask says: move to pepper_4 at (3, 1.5) - consistent.\n\nSo no discrepancy there.\n\nBut why is the first thought process about (3.5,1.5)? It\'s another object "pepper_3" not relevant here.\nHence confirmation that pepper_4 is correctly at (3.0,1.5).\n\nThus move_to_object  with id pepper_4 is correct choice given descriptions.\n\nHowever, if I was to use coordinates directly, it would be:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_position", "x": "3.0", "y": "1.5"}\n```\n\nGiven the ambiguity in function descriptions both could be argued.\nBut typically such problems expect you to abstract out pathfinding details hence move_to_object by id is more semantic and preferred unless coordinates are explicitly required.\n\nThus final answer is as above using object_id.\n\nBut looking back at problem statement again:\n\nThe task is: "Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.\n            Use correct object id.\n            Toolcall order matters."\n\nAnd planned action is moving towards pepper_4 (at position (3,1.5)).\nSo it\'s about moving to object pepper_4 by its id. Hence move_to_object with id=pepper_4 is indeed the correct choice.\n\nThus:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_4"}\n```\n\nBut wait, the function description says: "The human moves to a position."  - same for both functions! That seems like a mistake likely. Probably second one should be "moves to an object by its id".\n\nGiven that likely oversight in docs, and since planned action is moving towards pepper_4 (object by id), 95% confident move_to_object with pepper_4\'s id is correct.\n\nBut if we had to use coordinates for some reason despite having object ids available, then it\'d be move_to_position 3.0,1.5.\nGiven the ambiguity in descriptions, but logical consistency that move_to_object refers to target by id, go with former.\n\nFinal:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_4"}\n```\n\nBut let me see if any other actions are implied by "planned action is moving towards pepper_4". No interaction or pickup is mentioned. So just the movement to object should suffice.\n\n</think>\n\n### Summary of Reasoning and Final Answer\n\nGiven the initial position, room layout, and the target position (3.0, 1.5) where `pepper_4` is located, the human can move directly towards it. The most appropriate tool call is using `move_to_object` to specify moving to the object by its ID (`pepper_4`).\n\nThe planned action does not require interaction with the object or manipulation of inventory items; hence, only one tool call is needed.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_4"}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\text{move\\_to\\_object with object\\_id = pepper\\_4}}' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2354, 'prompt_tokens': 1247, 'total_tokens': 3601, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-826', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b02b9-55f7-7801-9cc5-85d8929511ac-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1247, 'output_tokens': 2354, 'total_tokens': 3601, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

Take one of the peppers - chosen as pepper_3 based on interpretation despite mention of "4.5", as that\'s within room bounds.\n\nThus, toolcalls in order are:\n```json\n[\n  {"function": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.0"}},\n  {"function": "take_from", "parameters": {"from_id": "pepper_3", "what_id": "pepper"}}\n]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Moved to (3.5, 1.0) which is near pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5) and pepper_5 at same x but y=1.0. Wait no - pepper_3 is at (3.5,1.5), so better to move to y=1.5 to align with its location for accurate interaction.\nWait, original move was to (3.5, 1.0) targeting pepper_5 located there but task mentions pepper (likely pepper_3 at 3.5,1.5). Need correction:\n\nCorrect movement should be toward the exact position intended. Given confusion in coords, if taking "pepper_3" then move to its (x=3.5,y=1.5):\n\nRevised plan:\n- Move to x=3.5, y=1.5 (location of pepper_3).\n- Then takefrom pepper_3.\n\nSo toolcalls:\n```json\n[\n  {"function": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"function]: "take_from", "parameters": {"from_id": "pepper_3", "what_id": "pepper"} }\n]\n```\n\nBut initial task says "Move right, take pepper at 4.5 to go left". If we ignore the impossible (4.5) as typo and assume it\'s x=3.5,y=1.5 then above works.\n\nAlternative if "take pepper at position where you would normally have x=4.5" which is out of bounds - perhaps imply move right to edge (x=3.x or 4.0) then take nearest pepper like pepper_3 or _4(_4 is at 3.0).\n\nGiven ambiguity, primary clear action sequence from root task with correction re "take pepper_3":\n\nFinal tools:\n```json\n[\n  {"function": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"function]: "take_from", "parameters": {"from_id": "pepper_3", "what_id": "pepper"} }\n]\n```\n\nBut if task meant take pepper then move left, sequence would differ: first move to pepper posn (as above), take it, then move left. But initial instruction is "move right [then] take pepper at 4.5...", which combined suggests:\n\n1) move right to somewhere beyond pepper positions (but max x=room extend_x - start=0 is 4.0). So maybe intent was move near a pepper by moving right, then take that pepper.\n\nGiven only peppers are at x:3.0 and two at x:3.5, and table at same x as peppers.\nSo "move right to reach leftmost object" - wait unclear. Maybe "move right in general (increase x) towards where pepper at highest x is located (x=3.5), then take that pepper (pepper_3)" which aligns with plan above.\n\nThus proceeding with:\n```json\n[\n  {"function": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"function": "take_from", "parameters": {"from_id": "pepper_3", "what_id": "pepper"}}\n]\n```\nas the most plausible sequence.\nFinal output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {"function": "move_to_position", "parameters": {"x": "3.5", "y": "1.5"}},\n  {"function": "take_from", "parameters": {"from_id": "pepper_3", "what_id": "pepper"}}\n]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1997, 'prompt_tokens': 1246, 'total_tokens': 3243, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-931', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b02bc-2b1a-7a62-acfb-89903b1e391c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1246, 'output_tokens': 1997, 'total_tokens': 3243, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='Final answer as toolcalls only:\n```json\n{"toolcall": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_4"}}}\n```\n\nBut wait, the user\'s initial state shows inventory is empty and perception includes pepper_4 at (3.0,1.5). The action GoTo id=pepper_4 position=(3.0,1.5) translates directly to moving towards that object\'s known position using its identifier. Hence move_to_object with pepper_4 as argument is indeed correct.\n\nHowever considering that the tool function description for move_to_position is "the human moves to a position" and similarly for move_to_object as "The human moves to a position" - both seem to imply moving to some location, but one takes coordinates while other uses object id as reference point. Since our planned action specifies movement towards an object identified by its id at known coordinates (though the tool doesn\'t need us to know current position implicitly), move_to_object is appropriate here.\n\nThus verifying that this seems correct - move to pepper_4 using its id, which will direct movement towards its current position in space (the specific coordinates are system-handled based on perceived state).\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any implication of doing positioning relative to items. The room dimensions are 4x2 extend_x and extend_y with you starting at (0,0). Pepper_4 is at (3.0,1.5) which is within those bounds.\n\nNo further operations are needed pre or post move based on given task constraints, so finalizing the single toolcall for this movement:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_4"}}}\n```\n\nBut wait, looking back at initial thought process, another perspective is that since position data of pepper_4 is given as (3.0,1.5) in perception and the action specifies go to this position where pepper_4 is located, perhaps move_to_position with these coordinates is also valid even more direct.\n\nHowever the planned action string starts with "id=pepper_4" before giving position which might imply priority on navigating towards object via id rather than arbitrary coordinate movement. But functionally either method achieves same spatial outcome in this case since pepper_4\'s location is (3.0,1.5).\n\nNoting that tool descriptions both achieve moving to a position, with distinction only in how target destination is specified.\n\nGiven ambiguity in interpretation of intended vs functionally equivalent actions, both:\n\nmove_to_position(3.0, 1.5) or\nmove_to_object("pepper_4")\n\nare technically correct but may have differing nuanced meanings per function names implying different contextual usage - objects for items and positions for spatial coordinates.\n\nIn robotics/planning context moving directly to coordinate is more "primitive" while moving to object is higher level abstraction incorporating identity-based navigation. Given input format specifies both id and position, likely the latter (object-based move) is intended here for clarity matching planned action phrasing starting with id=..., hence move_to_object\n\nThus final decision is to use:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_4"}}}\n```\n\nBut reflecting more carefully, the problem asks for toolcalls arising from the planned action. The planned action is given in format: GoTo id=name position=(x,y). Here it\'s clear that both the identifier and its current position are being specified together to denote same movement goal - reaching pepper_4 where it currently is at (3,1.5).\n\nBetween the two available tool functions:\n- move_to_position would directly encode the destination coordinates.\n- move_to_object encodes moving towards object by id whose location implicitly satisfies those coordinates in this case.\n\nThe planned action format mentions id first then position in a way that suggests the primary target is object id with position as additional info (perhaps for context/validation). Hence likely the intended toolcall is by object_id not coordinates directly, meaning move_to_object("pepper_4") as it refers directly to the named entity of interest to approach.\n\nAdditionally since current environment state in perception has pepper_4 located at given position, and there\'s no stated need to explicitly handle coordinates separately here since the system would internally resolve pepper_4\'s location based on its id (using current perception data where it\'s shown at those coordinates), thus using object-based movement is more appropriate semantically matching the planned action phrasing.\n\nTherefore final answer:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_4"}}}\n```\n\nHowever, to ensure full alignment with the problem’s instructions and avoid ambiguity, let\'s also consider that if the task expects explicit use of positional data in planned actions, then move_to_position might be required. But given both functions achieve same outcome when object position matches target coordinates (as here), and since planned action starts with id=..., which alignswithmove_to_object function’s parameters and common usage where you’d refer to items by identity not raw grid positions.\n\nThus concluding on:\n\n```json\n{"toolcall": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_4"}}}\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2903, 'prompt_tokens': 1253, 'total_tokens': 4156, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-6', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b02c0-ad1a-7a00-8817-7645caafcf5b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1253, 'output_tokens': 2903, 'total_tokens': 4156, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
            

content='Here\'s a concise summary of my thoughts and the final answer:\n\nThe primary task is to move to the table identified by "table_6". No additional actions are specified in this step.\n\nFinal toolcall:\n```json\n{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}\n```\n\nBut wait, looking again at the full input including the reasoning steps added in the problem statement:\n\nThe text includes a sequence of thoughts that first suggest moving to table at table_6 but then question if it\'s optimal and propose an alternative like picking up pepper items first. But it ends with saying that after taking pepper4, go to pepper3, and then repeats the task request again.\n\nGiven this confusing structure where part is reasoning on actions and rest is the static task parameters (room info), I think the action to toolcall for is as stated after the word "ACTION" in the reasoning:\n\n"ACTION: move from (3.0, 1.5) to table_6 at position (3.5, 0.5)."\n\nEven though further down it suggests alternatives those seem like \'imagination\' notes rather than the concrete task which seems to be just this Action of moving to table_6.\n\nThus only one tool call is needed for this action: moving to object by id.\n\nBut reviewing again carefully:\n\nAt position (3.0,1.5) and table is at (3.5, 0.5). The \'action\' line says move from first pos to table\'s position with its ID given as "table_6". So yes single move_to_object toolcall with that id.\n\nTherefore the answer only consists of:\n```json\n{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}\n```\n\nHowever another read shows the "ACTION" line specifies moving from current position to table\'s position by referring to its ID. So just that one tool call as above seems correct.\n\nBut wait in the problem statement there is this:\n\nSo instead: move to (3.5,1.0) and take pepper_5 from there.\n\nThus perhaps both those two commands are part of planned action. Unclear which to pick since both "ACTION" line and \'so instead\' seem to be part of the reasoning steps before final task at end which just asks for toolcals from planned action, but unclear which of those is indeed planned action to use (the initial or alternate). Probably initial one - moving directly to table_6.\n\nBut to match completely the very next line of text starting with \'ACTION\':\n\nmove from current pos to table\'s position (given by its ID).\n\nSo final toolcall would be:\n\n```json\n{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}\n```\n\nThus this is it. The reasoning mentions alternatives but they\'re prefaced as not being correct direction initially, and later thoughts exploring alternatives but main action is move to table_6, before task repeating at bottom. So most likely intent is for toolcal from that primary action specified after \'ACTION:\'\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n```json\n{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}\n```\n\nBut looking very carefully again the full input has original room state and objects etc. After that it shows reasoning with some exploration of different paths, then "Task:" repeating the instruction to give toolcalls from planned action (i.e. the one after \'ACTION:\' line which is moving to table with id), and then there\'s a snippet showing the move command they did, (3.0,1.5) to table at (3.5,0.5) via its ID \'table_6\'.\n\nThus the planned action is as in that line so toolcall for moving to \'table_6\':\n\n```json\n{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}\n```\n\nSo final answer:\n\n```json\n[{"function":"move_to_object","object_id":"table_6"}]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1882, 'prompt_tokens': 1329, 'total_tokens': 3211, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-791', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b02cd-df85-7b92-a0b9-cdffe9b59893-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1329, 'output_tokens': 1882, 'total_tokens': 3211, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

content='The action is simply moving to the object identified by "pepper_3" using `move_to_object` function. Since both the human and the object are on the same plane (y-coordinate), and no obstacles or additional steps are mentioned, the solution involves a single function call.\n\n```json\n{"object_id": "pepper_3", "action": "move_to_object"}\n```\n\nBut to strictly follow the format required with `function` key, it should be presented as:\n\n```json\n{"functions": [{"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}]}\n```\n\nHowever based on initial instruction where answer must only consist of toolcalls (and sample in problem says to give exactly the toolcalls), and earlier template shows using `action` keys, but perhaps it expects raw function calls like:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}\n```\n\nGiven ambiguity, and based on initial problem\'s first part which shows a list of functions with \'name\' and \'parameters\', likely the expected output is in that format.\n\nFinal answer would hence be structured as the function call parameters:\n\n```json\n{"functions": [{"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}]}\n```\n\nBut to match exactly with what was asked: give exactly the toolcalls in correct order, likely it\'s expecting just the call with name and parameters.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}\n```\n\nBut reviewing again, the initial format given for functions had \'name\' and \'parameters\', and the instruction is to give toolcalls that arise from planned action. A toolcall being essentially what would be passed to an API or function invocation.\n\nTherefore most likely expected output:\n\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}\n```\n\nBut looking back at functions defined earlier, they have a specific structure. Maybe the exact expected format is to list them under \'functions\' key with \'name\' and \'parameters\'.\n\nGiven ambiguity here\'s both possibilities:\n\n1) If expecting a function call as per standard API call structure:\n```json\n{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}\n```\n\n2) If expecting it in the function definition format provided initially (with \'functions\', \'name\' and \'parameters\'):\n```json\n{"functions": [{"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}]}\n```\n\nGiven initial instructions said: "Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.", and initial template for thinking process shows function calls typically start with naming the action first, likely option 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps the problem expects format matching the initial functions definition given at start (with \'functions\' key etc.).\n\nGiven that\'s not specified, minimal necessary toolcall would be first version.\n\nHowever, in standard API calling conventions and from the problem setup where functions are defined with \'name\' and \'parameters\', it aligns better to provide as in second format.\n\nThus, most accurate based on given definitions:\n\n```json\n{"functions": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}}], "action": "move_to_object"}\n```\n\nBut that seems redundant. Maybe just:\n\n```json\n{"functions": [{"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}]}\n```\n\nGiven time, and initial instruction to give exactly toolcalls arising from planned action (which is move to pepper_3), the simplest and likely expected answer is:\n\n```json\n[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}]\n```\n\nBut format with \'functions\' array seems closer to problem\'s initial structure.\n\nFinal answer in required format as per initial function definitions:\n\n```json\n{"functions": [{"name": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "pepper_3"}}]}\n```\n\n\\boxed{[{"action": "move_to_object", "object_id": "pepper_3"}]}' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2601, 'prompt_tokens': 1239, 'total_tokens': 3840, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-497', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b02d1-071f-7672-807a-b4fbe7238999-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1239, 'output_tokens': 2601, 'total_tokens': 3840, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] In the provided environment, there are three peppers and a table located in various positions within the room. Here's a breakdown of the entities:

1. Pepper at position (3.5, 1.5) with ID "pepper_3"
2. Pepper at position (3.0, 1.5) with ID "pepper_4"
3. Table at position (3.5, 0.5) with ID "table_6", which is currently empty
4. Pepper at position (3.5, 1.0) with ID "pepper_5"

Based on the given instructions, I should collect all peppers and place them on the table.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Move to the position of the nearest pepper: either "pepper_3" at (3.5, 1.5) or "pepper_4" at (3.0, 1.5). Both are equidistant from my current position (3.0, 1.5), so I can choose either.
2. Pick up the pepper at (3.5, 1.5).
3. Move to the table's position at (3.5, 0.5).
4. Place the picked-up pepper onto the table.
5. Return to collect the remaining peppers.

Here is the explicit short answer for the best next action:

"Pick up the pepper at (3.5, 1.5) or alternatively pick up the pepper at (3.0, 1.5)."

(Note: Since you are already standing on top of the pepper at (3.0, 1.5), you might prefer to pick that one first.)
