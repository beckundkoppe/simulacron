content='Based on the given problem and reasoning process, here’s a concise summary of the steps taken to determine the correct action:\n\n1. Identify available functions: There are two relevant functions for movement:\n   - `move_to_position` which requires x and y coordinates.\n   - `move_to_object` which requires an object_id.\n\n2. Analyze task specification in relation to available data:\n   - Current position is at (0.0, 0.0).\n   - Objects detected are table (id:table_4) at (3.5, 0.5) and cucumber (id:cucumber_3) at (3.5, 1.5).\n   - The task specified is "move_to_object", aligning with the `move_to_object` function.\n\n3. Select object for movement:\n   - Without additional context specifying the target object, both table and cucumber are potential targets.\n   - Assume the primary object to move towards based on initial description order is acceptable; here we choose "table_4" as it appears first in the list.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n```\n\nHowever, if moving towards the cucumber was intended (as a more interactive object), the call would instead target its id. Given the ambiguity and since both objects meet criteria without further constraints, either choice of id would technically fulfill the instruction, but consistency with initial description order favors the table.\n\nThus most likely intended answer per instructions is move to "table_4" as follows:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n```\n\nBut if previous context (now hidden in <think> block) implied starting actions for picking up cucumber next, then logical sequence would involve moving near cucumber first. Given initial setup likely expects usage of both movement and item manipulation functions in broader scenario but task here isolates to single move function call.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but assuming strict adherence to given instructions without relying external context (as the task is presumably standalone after reasoning block): since instruction specifies using correct object id for move_to_object action from planned action and our perception lists two objects with ids table_4 and cucumber_3, and task starts fresh as "move_to_object Task:", we can choose either. If we assume ‘reasoning: {imagination}’ was placeholder indicating to imagine moving towards something to act on next like the cucumber (as tables are less likely targets unless for actions not listed here), then logical object_id may be “cucumber_3”:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\nGiven problem statement does not finalize which object is target and initial setup lists both under perception with no other context (like needing to interact with table first for something else), most neutral answer would be to pick the first listed object - table unless specific actions follow in broader problem not shown here.\n\nFor this stand-alone instruction, we generate the tool invocation selecting the first perceived object’s ID:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n```\n\nFinal Answer (after reconsideration of ambiguity):\n\nGiven that both objects are present and no specific objective is mentioned beyond performing the move action towards \'an object\', either object_id would satisfy the immediate task requirement. Without loss of generality, we can present the solution as:\n\n```json\n[{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}]\n```\n\nHowever, if the broader intent involves interacting with the cucumber after moving (hinted by the presence of \'take\' in available functions and cucumber being an item one might pick), alternative answer could be preferred. Since original task does not specify this dependency and only requests tool calls for \'move_to_object\', either object is valid target, making choice between them situationally dependent rather than objectively determined by given input.\n\nThus primary answer remains first table object.\n\nFor absolute minimality respecting instruction to generate all required function calls given task (which only requires one move action):\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n```\n\nComplete code block output for the action:\n\n```json\n{"function": "move_to_object", "parameters": {"object_id": "table_4"}}\n\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3383, 'prompt_tokens': 1108, 'total_tokens': 4491, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-254', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0277-a49a-7840-a234-eb62e1110621-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1108, 'output_tokens': 3383, 'total_tokens': 4491, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

Unless it\'s implied that objects can be referenced by IDs for movement.\n\nGiven ambiguity in how \'nearby\' relates to movement (whether move_toPosition updates internal position state vs just proximity flags), but since exact coordinates accompany object descriptions, and task specifies moving to their positions literally, the toolcall sequence should likely reflect coordinate-based movement first.\n\nBut also considering that other functions may implicitly rely on proximity rather than exact positional states managed by the system - moving via IDs (move_to_object) might be how it\'s expected users navigate in this world model. The position coordinates could still be for user\'s reference rather than as direct control inputs.

Coordinates are likely supplementary details about scene layout but not required for movement action commands when IDs suffice.\n\nThus final answer would be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```\n\nBoth achieve going to their respective positions, satisfying the task with proper object ID usage as per other function constraints.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_4"}},\n  {"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n]\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2067, 'prompt_tokens': 1112, 'total_tokens': 3179, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-351', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b0280-c76b-7a33-9b68-f7eef9789fee-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1112, 'output_tokens': 2067, 'total_tokens': 3179, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
