Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **pepper_5** is now on the table (table_6).  
- **pepper_3** and **pepper_4** remain on the floor.  

**Facts:**  
- The agent successfully placed **pepper_5** on the table.  
- The table is empty except for **pepper_5**.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Only **pepper_5** was targeted (others remain uncollected).  
- Movement to (3.5,1) was optimal to collect **pepper_5** (valid, as it’s directly below its initial position).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- The path to collect **pepper_5** was correct.  
- The table’s position (3.5,0.5) is valid for dropping items.  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- No further actions were taken to collect **pepper_3** or **pepper_4**.
