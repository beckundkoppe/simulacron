[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- **Human’s position**: Now at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **Cucumber**: Still at (3.5, 1.5) – it has not been picked up.  
- **Table**: Remains at (3.5, 0.5) and still empty.  
- **Human’s inventory**: Empty – the cucumber has not been grasped.  

**Assumptions made and their validity**

| Assumption | Outcome | Verdict |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Cucumber is at (3.5, 1.5) | Confirmed by the state | **Correct** |
| Table is at (3.5, 0.5) and empty | Confirmed | **Correct** |
| Human can move to the cucumber’s location | Human is now there | **Correct** |
| The goal “pick up and place cucumber on table” is achieved | Not achieved – only movement performed | **Incorrect** |

**Summary**

The action sequence only moved the human to the cucumber’s location. The cucumber remains on the floor, the table is still empty, and the human is not holding the cucumber. The goal of picking up the cucumber and placing it on the table has not yet been satisfied.

[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

| Item | Location / State |
|------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) – standing on the cucumber |
| Cucumber | In human’s inventory (collected) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5), still empty |
| Potato | (0.5, 1.5) – unchanged |
| Wooden chest | (2.0, 2.0), closed & unlocked – unchanged |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5) and could be grasped.  
2. The human’s inventory was empty before the action.  
3. The table remained empty after the cucumber was picked up.  
4. No other objects moved or changed state.

**Assumptions that proved correct**

- Cucumber was indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Human could pick it up (inventory now contains the cucumber).  
- Table stayed empty.  
- Potato and chest positions/states unchanged.

**Assumptions that proved incorrect**

- The cucumber was not already in the human’s inventory before the action (it was on the floor).  
- The goal “place cucumber on the table” was not yet achieved; only the pick‑up step was completed.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Item | New state |
|------|-----------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) – standing on the table |

| Table | (3.5, 0.5), now holding the cucumber |
| Potato | (0.5, 1.5) – unchanged |
| Wooden chest | (2.0, 2.0), closed & unlocked – unchanged |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5) and could be grasped.  
2. The table was empty before the cucumber was placed on it.  
3. The human could move from the cucumber to the table without obstruction.  
4. No other objects moved or changed state during the sequence.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- Cucumber was indeed at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Table was empty before placement.  
- Human successfully moved to the table.  
- Potato and chest remained unchanged.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- None; all assumptions held true.
