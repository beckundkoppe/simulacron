[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is now at (3.5, 1.5).  
- The cucumber remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- The table is still at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Human is not holding the cucumber.

**Assumptions made**

1. The path from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.5, 1.5) was clear and the move succeeded.  
2. The cucumber was indeed at (3.5, 1.5) when the move was executed.  
3. No other objects or constraints interfered with the move.

**Verification**

- Assumption 1: **Correct** – the move was executed without error.  
- Assumption 2: **Correct** – the cucumber’s location matches the stated facts.  
- Assumption 3: **Correct** – no obstacles were reported.

The state is now ready for the next steps: pick up the cucumber and place it on the table.
