Goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [144] Place the carrot from your inventory on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The plan “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” is still a single high‑level action.  
To execute it we must first ensure that:

1. The carrot is in the human’s inventory (assumed true, but still a precondition).  
2. The human is standing on the table.  
3. The “place” action is performed.

Thus the plan needs to be broken down into the sub‑steps: move to the table, then place the carrot. Only after these sub‑goals are satisfied can the final action be carried out.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1.0,4.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

- The human agent is now at coordinates (1.0, 4.0), which corresponds to the table’s location.  
- The carrot remains in the human’s inventory (it has not been moved or placed).  
- No other objects have changed state.

**Assumptions that were made**

1. **Moving to the table is sufficient to place the carrot.**  
   *Assumption status:* Wrong – the action only moved the agent; it did not transfer the carrot to the table.

2. **The chair was used to climb onto the table.**  
   *Assumption status:* Unverified – the action log shows only a move; there is no evidence that the chair was interacted with or that the agent actually climbed onto the table.

3. **The human is now able to place the carrot on the table.**  
   *Assumption status:* Likely true (the agent is at the table), but the action to place the carrot has not yet been executed.

**Summary**

The agent successfully reached the table, but the carrot has not yet been placed. The plan’s first step was correct, but the subsequent step to actually put the carrot on the table was omitted. The next minimal action should be to “take the carrot from inventory and place it on the table.”

The plan only moves the agent to the table (and suggests using a chair to climb onto it). It does not include the action of taking the carrot from the inventory and placing it on the table, which is the requested goal. Therefore the plan is incomplete.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The agent has already reached the table, and the carrot is still in the inventory. Using a chair to climb onto the table is unnecessary and has not yet been attempted, so the plan does not advance toward placing the carrot.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

Plan:
Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
