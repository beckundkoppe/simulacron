[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Pepper_5 is collected and in the agent's inventory.  
- Agent is at (3.5,1).  
- Table_6 remains empty and at (3.5,0.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
- Pepper_4 and pepper_3 are still in their original positions.  
- The agent can collect remaining peppers and place them on the table.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Collecting pepper_5 worked as expected.  
**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- The positions of pepper_4 and pepper_3 are unchanged (no movement yet).  
- The table remains empty (no prior interaction).  

**Next Steps:** Move to pepper_4 → collect → move to pepper_3 → collect → move to table → place all peppers.
