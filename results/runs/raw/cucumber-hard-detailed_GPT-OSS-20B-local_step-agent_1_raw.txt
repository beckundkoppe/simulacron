**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Moving to that coordinate is possible and will bring the human to the cucumber.  
3. No other actions (pick‑up, place) were performed in this step.

**What proved right / wrong**

- **Right**: The cucumber is indeed at (3.5, 1.5); the human successfully moved there.  
- **Wrong**: The cucumber was not picked up, and it was not placed on the table. Those actions remain pending.
