Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Attempted to open the chest, but the interaction had no effect.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is in the adjacent room.  
- Chest is closed (validated).  
- Potato is inside the chest (confirmed).  

**Assumptions:**  
- Chest is closed (validated).  
- Potato is reachable once chest is opened (assumed).  
- "Open" action is applicable to the chest (unvalidated).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Chest is closed (correct).  
- Potato is inside the chest (confirmed).  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- "Open" action works on the chest (failed).  
- Chest is a standard openable object (possibly incorrect).  

**Result:** The "open" action failed. The chest may not be openable via standard interaction. Next steps: **inspect chest** (to find alternative method) → **take potato** → **return to main room** → **place on table**.  

**Action Failure Reason:** The "open" action had no effect, suggesting the chest is not a standard openable object. Alternative methods (e.g., "inspect" or "use") may be required.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Moved to (0,0)** (adjacent room).  
- **Collected potato_7 from chest_9** (successfully).  

**Facts:**  
- Agent now holds the potato.  
- Potato was inside the chest (confirmed).  
- Chest was closed (previously validated), but the "collect" action bypassed the need to open it.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Chest is a standard openable object (unvalidated, failed).

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Potato is in the chest (correct).  
- "Collect" action retrieves the potato (correct).  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- Chest required opening (incorrect, as "collect" bypassed this).  

**Result:** Potato is now in inventory. Next steps: **return to main room** → **place potato on table**.  

**Action Summary:**  
- **Collected potato** directly from chest (no need to open).  
- **Move to main room** (door is open).

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Dropped potato_7 into shelf_10** (incorrect action).  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_7 is on the shelf** (not on the table).

- **Door to main room is open**.  

**Assumptions About New State:**

- **Potato was in inventory** (correct).  
- **Chest_9 is empty** (correct).  

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- **Potato needed to be placed on table** (failed due to incorrect action).
