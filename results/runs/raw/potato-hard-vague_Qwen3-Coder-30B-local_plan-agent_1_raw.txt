[observer] I observe a potato on the table at position (0.0, 4.0). 

Verification: The perception shows a table at (0.0, 4.0) with "contents_count: empty", but there's also a "potato" in the perception list at position (0.0, 4.0) - this appears to be a discrepancy in the data.

Relevant discoveries:
- There is a potato at position (0.0, 4.0) - this is a new discovery
- The table at (0.0, 4.0) is currently empty according to the table's contents_count, but the potato is listed as being at that same position

The potato is the only new discovery, though there's a data inconsistency between the table's empty status and the potato's presence at the same location.

The action moved the agent to table_4 at position (0.0, 4.0).

- Agent is now at table_4 location
- Table at (0.0, 4.0) shows "contents_count: empty" 
- Potato is observed at position (0.0, 4.0)

- The potato should be placed on the table
- The table should contain the potato after placement

The goal was already achieved - the potato is already on the table at the correct location. No further action needed.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**
- Moved to table_4 at (0.0, 4.0) 
- Dropped diamond_5 into table_4

**Facts:**
- Agent is at table_4 location
- Table shows "contents_count: contains 1" with diamond
- Diamond_5 is now in table_4
- No potato at table location

**Assumptions:**
- Potato should be placed on table
- Table should contain potato after placement

- Assumption that potato was at table location (it wasn't)
- Assumption that goal was already achieved

**What proved right:**
- Table is at (0.0, 4.0) as expected

**Conclusion:**
The actions were incorrect - they placed diamond_5 in the table instead of a potato. The goal of placing a potato on the table has not been achieved.
