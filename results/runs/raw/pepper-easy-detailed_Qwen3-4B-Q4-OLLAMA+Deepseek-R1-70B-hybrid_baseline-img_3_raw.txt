Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Move to (3.5, 1.0) and take Pepper_5.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Current Position**: At (0.0, 0.0).
2. **Target Pepper**: Pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0).
3. **Action**: Move to the position of Pepper_5.
4. **Next Action**: Take Pepper_5 to add it to your inventory.

This approach starts collecting peppers one by one, moving efficiently towards each, and placing them on the table subsequently.
