|------------|---------|
| The human can occupy the same coordinates as pepper_3 without picking it up. | **True** – the action only moved the human; pepper_3 remains at (3.5, 1.5). |
| The move is possible (no obstacles or restrictions). | **True** – the action executed successfully. |
| No other objects were affected by the move. | **True** – only the human’s position changed. |

1. **Pick‑up pepper_3**

   * No objects are moved or altered by this step.  
   * pepper_5 remains at (3.5, 1.0) (human shares the same coordinates but does not automatically pick it up).  
   * pepper_4 and table_6 remain unchanged.

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can occupy the same coordinates as an object without automatically picking it up.  
2. Picking up an object removes it from the world location and places it in the inventory.  
3. Moving does not affect other objects.

**Verification**

- Assumption 1: **True** – the human is now at (3.5, 1.0) while pepper_5 remains at the same spot.  
- Assumption 2: **True** – pepper_3 is in inventory.  
- Assumption 3: **True** – no other objects were moved or altered.

All assumptions proved correct; the new state is consistent with the performed actions.

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can pick up an object that occupies the same coordinates.  
2. Placing an object moves it from inventory to the current location.  
3. Moving does not affect objects already in inventory.  
4. The table is the only surface at (3.5, 0.5) where objects can be placed.

**Verification**

- Assumption 1: **True** – pepper_4 was successfully collected.  
- Assumption 2: **True** – all three peppers appear at the table.  
- Assumption 3: **True** – inventory was empty after placing all peppers.  
- Assumption 4: **True** – the table_6 is at (3.5, 0.5) and now holds all peppers.  

All assumptions proved correct. No contradictions arose.

| Object   | Location / State                     |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| human    | (3.5, 0.5)                           |
| pepper_3 | (3.5, 0.5) (on table_6)              |

| pepper_4 | (3.5, 0.5) (on table_6)              |
| table_6  | contains pepper_3, pepper_5, pepper_4|

**Assumptions made**

1. Dropping an object removes it from inventory and places it at the human’s current location.  
2. The current location (3.5, 0.5) is a valid surface (table_6) for placing objects.  
3. Inventory contents update immediately after each drop.

**Verification**

All three assumptions proved correct; the final state matches the expected outcome. No contradictions or new discoveries were observed.

[reflector] **Effect of the action “collected pepper_5”**

- **Facts after execution**  
  - Human remains at (3.5, 0.5).  
  - `table_6` now contains only `pepper_3` and `pepper_4`.  
  - `pepper_5` is in the human’s inventory.  

- **Assumptions made**  
  1. `pepper_5` was present on `table_6` and could be picked up.  
  2. Picking up an object removes it from the surface and adds it to the inventory.  
  3. The inventory updates immediately after the pick‑up.  

- **Assumptions proved**  
  All three assumptions held true; the state matches the expected outcome.
