[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- Human moved from (3, 1.5) to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- No objects were moved or placed; the human is still holding all three peppers.  
- The table remains empty.

**Current facts**

| Object | State / Location |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Human is holding pepper_5 | inventory |
| Human is holding pepper_3 | inventory |
| Human is holding pepper_4 | inventory |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) – empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can move freely to the table location.  
2. The table is empty when the human arrives.  

**Assumptions verified**

- Assumption 1: correct – the move succeeded.  
- Assumption 2: correct – the table was empty.  

**Note**  
The goal “place all peppers on the table” has not yet been achieved; the next minimal action would be to drop each pepper onto the table.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**

- The human dropped pepper_5 onto the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Pepper_5 is now on the table (no longer in the human’s inventory).  
- The human remains at (3.5, 0.5) holding pepper_3 and pepper_4.  
- The table now contains pepper_5; pepper_3 and pepper_4 are still in the human’s inventory.

**Current facts**

| Object | State / Location |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Human is holding pepper_3 | inventory |
| Human is holding pepper_4 | inventory |
| pepper_5 | on table (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table | contains pepper_5 |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can drop an item onto the table.  
2. The table can hold pepper_5.  
3. Pepper_5 was in the human’s inventory before the drop.

**Assumptions verified**

- All three assumptions proved correct.  

**Note**  
The goal “place all peppers on the table” is not yet satisfied; pepper_3 and pepper_4 remain in the human’s inventory. The next minimal actions would be to drop pepper_3 and then pepper_4 onto the table.
