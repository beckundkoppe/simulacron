Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved to (3.5, 1.0) and **picked up** pepper_5.  
- Pepper_5 is now in the inventory; it is no longer at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Inventory now contains pepper_4, pepper_3, and pepper_5.  
- Human remains at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Table stays at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.  

**Updated facts**

| Item      | Location | In inventory? |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Human     | (3.5, 1.0) | – |
| pepper_4  | – (held) | Yes |
| pepper_3  | – (held) | Yes |
| pepper_5  | – (held) | Yes |
| table     | (3.5, 0.5) | – |

**Assumptions made**

1. The human can move freely to the coordinates of pepper_5.  
2. Moving to pepper_5’s location does **not** automatically pick it up.  
3. No other objects or state changes occur during the move.  
4. Picking up an object changes its location to “held” and updates the inventory.

**Which assumptions proved true**

- Assumption 1: **True** – the human reached (3.5, 1.0).  
- Assumption 2: **True** – pepper_5 was not in inventory until the explicit pick‑up.  
- Assumption 3: **True** – all other objects stayed unchanged.  
- Assumption 4: **True** – pepper_5 moved to the inventory.

4. No other objects or state changes occur during the drop.
