1. The cucumber was correctly located at (3.5, 1.5). – **True**

The goal “Place the cucumber on the table” was not achieved; the cucumber is still on the floor above the table. The action only moved the human to the cucumber’s position.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

1. `pick cucumber` – cucumber moved from the floor to the human’s inventory.  
2. `move (3.5, 0.5)` – human moved down 1 unit to the table’s location.  
3. `place cucumber` – cucumber was placed on the table, now at the same coordinates as the table.

**Resulting facts**

| Item      | Position |
|-----------|----------|
| Human     | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Cucumber  | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table     | (3.5, 0.5) |

**Assumptions evaluated**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5). | **True** |
| Human must pick the cucumber before placing it. | **True** |
| Moving to the table’s coordinates places the cucumber on the table. | **True** |

All assumptions made for the goal were satisfied; the cucumber is now on the table.
