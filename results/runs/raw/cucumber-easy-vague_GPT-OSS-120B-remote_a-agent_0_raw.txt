[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- **Human position:** (3.5, 1.5) – now standing on the same tile as *cucumber_3*.
- **Cucumber:** still at (3.5, 1.5) and **not** in the inventory.
- **Table:** *table_4* remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.
- **Room:** still the “main” room; no other objects were moved or changed.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| Assumption | Was it correct? |
|------------|-----------------|
| The cucumber is reachable (no obstacles). | ✔︎ proved right – the human could move onto its tile. |
| Moving does **not** automatically pick up the cucumber. | ✔︎ proved right – the cucumber stays where it was. |
| The table is empty and unchanged by the move. | ✔︎ proved right – still empty at (3.5, 0.5). |
| The human stays in the same room after moving. | ✔︎ proved right – still in “main”. |

No other changes occurred. The next steps will need to pick up the cucumber and then place it on the table.

[observer] I see that I am standing at (3.5, 1.5) in the “main” room. A cucumber (cucumber_3) is exactly at my position, and the table (table_4) is directly below at (3.5, 0.5) with no items on it. My inventory is empty. These facts are all that are newly confirmed.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (collect cucumber_3)**  

- **Human position:** (3.5, 1.5) – unchanged.  
- **Inventory:** contains *cucumber_3*.  
- **Cucumber:** no longer on the floor; now in inventory.  
- **Table:** *table_4* remains at (3.5, 0.0 – 0.5) (still empty).  
- **Room:** still “main”.  

**Assumptions made before the collect action**

| Assumption | Was it correct? |
|------------|-----------------|
| The cucumber was pick‑up‑able from the same tile. | ✔︎ proved right – it was added to inventory. |
| Picking up does not move the human. | ✔︎ proved right – position unchanged. |
| No other objects are affected by a pick‑up. | ✔︎ proved right – table stays empty. |
| The inventory was empty, so the cucumber can be stored. | ✔︎ proved right – now inventory holds the cucumber. |

All assumptions held; no unexpected changes occurred.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move to (3.5, 0.5))**

- **Human position:** (3.5, 0.5) – now standing on the same tile as *table_4*.  
- **Inventory:** contains *cucumber_3* (still being carried).  
- **Cucumber:** not on the ground; it is in the inventory.  
- **Table:** *table_4* remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty (no objects placed on it).  
- **Room:** still “main”.  

**Assumptions made before the move**

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| The tile (3.5, 0.5) is reachable (no obstacles). | ✔︎ proved right – the human moved onto it. |
| Moving does **not** automatically drop carried items. | ✔︎ proved right – *cucumber_3* stays in inventory. |
| The table’s location does not change by moving onto it. | ✔︎ proved right – table stays at (3.5, 0.5). |
| No other objects are affected by the move. | ✔︎ proved right – everything else unchanged. |

**Summary** – The move successfully placed the human on the table’s tile while still holding the cucumber, setting up the next minimal action: **drop cucumber_3** onto the table.
