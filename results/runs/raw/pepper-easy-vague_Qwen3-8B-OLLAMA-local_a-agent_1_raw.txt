[observer] I observe three peppers positioned above the table:

- **pepper_4** at (3.0,1.5)

The **table** is at (3.5,0.5) and currently empty. All peppers are within reach.

**Facts:**  
- The table now contains pepper_5.  
- The agent’s position is at the table (3.5,0.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
- The agent could collect and drop pepper_5 (proven correct).  
- The other peppers (pepper_3, pepper_4) would be handled in subsequent steps (assumption, but not yet verified).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Pepper_5 was successfully placed on the table.  
**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- The remaining peppers will be addressed in future actions.
