[observer] I observe:
- Cucumber located at (3.5,1.5) - this is the target item to pick up
- Table located at (3.5,0.5) - this is the destination to place the cucumber
- The cucumber is within reach (distance < 1.0 from current position at 0.0,0.0)
- The table is within reach (distance < 1.0 from current position at 0.0,0.0)

No new discoveries beyond what's already in the perception. The cucumber and table positions are confirmed and relevant for the goal.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**
- Successfully moved to the cucumber location and picked it up
- The cucumber is now in the agent's inventory

**Facts:**
- Cucumber is collected and in hand
- Agent is at cucumber location (3.5,1.5)

**Assumptions proved right:**
- Cucumber was within reach (distance < 1.0)
- Cucumber was at the expected location (3.5,1.5)
- Table was within reach (distance < 1.0) - confirmed by goal requirement

**Assumptions that were made but not yet tested:**
- Table location (3.5,0.5) - will be tested in next action
- Ability to move to table location - will be tested in next action

The agent is now holding the cucumber and needs to move to the table to complete the goal.

[observer] I observe:

The cucumber is in hand and the table location is confirmed. The next action is to move to the table position to place the cucumber.
