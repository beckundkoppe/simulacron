[observer] I observe 3 spinach and 3 lettuce objects in the room. The spinach must go into the box, and lettuce must be placed on the shelf.

New discoveries:
- Spinach objects: spinach_5 at (1.5,3.0), spinach_7 at (3.5,4.5), spinach_6 at (2.0,0.5)
- Lettuce objects: lettuce_9 at (2.5,3.5), lettuce_8 at (0.5,2.5), lettuce_10 at (5.0,1.5)
- Box location: (0.0,5.0)
- Shelf location: (5.0,5.0)

The box and shelf are empty and available for placement. I am currently at (0.0,0.0).
