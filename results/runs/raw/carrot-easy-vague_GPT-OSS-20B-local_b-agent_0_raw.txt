[planner] **Initial Minimal Action Plan**

1. **Move to the carrot**  
   - Action: `move_to(carrot)`

2. **Pick up the carrot**  
   - Action: `take(carrot)`

3. **Move to the table**  
   - Action: `move_to(table)`

4. **Place the carrot on the table**  
   - Action: `drop(carrot, table)`

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Reflection on the executed action**

- **Action performed:** `move_to(table_3)`  
- **Resulting facts:**  
  - Human is now at `table_3`.  
  - The carrot remains in the human’s inventory (no change).  

**Assumptions evaluated**

| Assumption | Status | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Human moved to the carrot | **Not executed** | The only action performed was moving to the table. |
| Carrot was on the floor | **Wrong** | The carrot was already in inventory, so it was never on the floor. |
| Carrot was in inventory | **Correct** | The carrot stayed in inventory after the move. |
| Human moved to the table | **Correct** | The move action succeeded. |

**Conclusion:** The plan was partially executed; only the movement to the table occurred. The carrot is still in inventory, so the goal “Place the carrot on the table” has not yet been achieved.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No.  
The last executed action was only `move_to(table_3)`. The carrot is still in the human’s inventory, so the final step of dropping it on the table has not been performed. The plan is incomplete and the goal has not yet been achieved.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the plan is still viable.  
The only missing step is to drop the carrot onto the table.  
Executing `drop(carrot, table)` will satisfy the goal with no extra actions.
