Goal: Place the carrot on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [5] Place the carrot on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal "Place the carrot on the table" requires subtasks like locating the carrot, picking it up, navigating to the table, and putting it down. Without these decomposed steps, the plan cannot be executed meaningfully. 

**Answer:** No, the plan needs decomposition into subtasks (e.g., "Pick up carrot," "Go to table," "Put carrot on table") before execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined Plan:  
1. Pick up the carrot.  
2. Go to the table.  
3. Place the carrot on the table.  

This decomposition ensures all necessary steps are taken, assuming the carrot is not already in hand. If the carrot is already in hand, the plan simplifies to steps 2 and 3.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed. The steps "Pick up the carrot," "Go to the table," and "Place the carrot on the table" form a minimal sequence to achieve the goal. Assuming the carrot is accessible and the table is reachable, execution can proceed without additional steps. No further decomposition is needed. 

**Answer:** Yes.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. The plan to "Pick up the carrot" is redundant because the carrot is already in the inventory. The agent is already at the table's location, and the table is empty. The only remaining action is to drop the carrot, which requires no further steps. Repeating actions that do not modify the situation (e.g., picking up an already-held item) wastes steps and contradicts the minimal-action principle.

Plan tree:
- [9] Place the carrot on the table. (current focus)
Question: Is the current focus still the best leaf task to pursue next?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[active_leaf_qa_imaginator] Yes, the current focus remains the best leaf task. The carrot is in inventory, the agent is at the table's location, and the table is empty. No additional steps (e.g., moving, picking up) are required—directly dropping the carrot fulfills the goal with minimal action.

[user] Goal: Place the carrot on the table.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **New Discovery:**  
The carrot is in your inventory, and you are already at the table's position (1.0, 4.0) where the table is empty. No further movement is required—simply drop the carrot on the table.

[user] 
Plan:
Place the carrot on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Action:** Drop the carrot on the table.  

This directly achieves the goal since the agent is already at the table's location and the table is empty. No additional movement or steps are required.

[user] Plan:
Place the carrot on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Drop the carrot on the table.

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 5.0, "extend_y": 5.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 1.0, "y": 4.0}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "carrot", "id": "carrot_4"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_3", "position": "(1.0,4.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}]} Reasoning: Drop the carrot on the table. Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
