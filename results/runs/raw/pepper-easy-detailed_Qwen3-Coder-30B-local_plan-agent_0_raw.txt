[observer] I observe 3 peppers in the room:
- pepper_4 at (3.0, 1.5)
- pepper_5 at (3.5, 1.0) 
- pepper_3 at (3.5, 1.5)

I also observe a table at (3.5, 0.5) that is currently empty.

All peppers are located near the right side of the room, and the table is positioned nearby. The table has space to place the peppers on it.
