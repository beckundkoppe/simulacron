content='_from<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wants to take pepper_4 from the position (3.0, 1.5). First, I need to check if the function call is correct. The available functions include take_from, which requires what_id and from_id. The pepper_4 is an object, so what_id is "pepper_4". The from_id should be the position where it\'s located, which is (3.0,1.5). But wait, the function parameters for take_from have from_id as the id of the object or \'FLOOR\'. Wait, the position given is (3.0,1.5), but in the perception, the pepper_4 is at (3.0,1.5). However, the from_id should be the object\'s id, not the position. Wait, looking back at the function definition for take_from: the from_id is the id of the object B from which the item is taken or \'FLOOR\'. So, in this case, the pepper_4 is located at (3.0,1.5), but the object that contains it is probably the table or another object. Wait, looking at the perception data: the pepper_4 is listed as an object with position (3.0,1.5). So maybe it\'s a separate object. Wait, but in the perception, there\'s also a table_6 at (3.5,0.5) with contents including pepper_3. But pepper_4 is listed as a separate object. So, the from_id here would be the id of the object where the pepper is located. But the pepper_4 is directly at (3.0,1.5), so maybe the from_id is "pepper_4"? Wait, no. The take_from function\'s from_id is the object from which the item is taken. But in this case, the pepper_4 is an object, so maybe the from_id is "pepper_4"? But that doesn\'t make sense because you can\'t take from an object that\'s already the item. Wait, perhaps the from_id is the position, but the function\'s description says it\'s the id of the object or \'FLOOR\'. So maybe the from_id is the id of the object that contains the item. But in this case, the pepper_4 is an object, so maybe the from_id is "pepper_4"? But that would be taking from the object itself. Wait, maybe the function is designed such that if the item is on the floor, you use \'FLOOR\', otherwise, you use the object\'s id. But in this case, the pepper_4 is at (3.0,1.5), which is a position. But according to the perception, the pepper_4 is an object with that position. So perhaps the from_id is "pepper_4"? But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object that the item is on. But in this case, the item is directly at that position. Hmm. Wait, the function\'s description says: "the id of the object B from which the item is taken or \'FLOOR\' for the floor". So if the item is on the floor, use \'FLOOR\', else use the object\'s id. But in this case, the item is an object, so maybe the from_id is the object\'s id. Wait, but the item is the object itself. That doesn\'t make sense. Maybe the function is designed to take from the object that the item is located on. For example, if the item is on a table, then from_id is the table\'s id. But in this case, the item is an object, so perhaps the from_id is the object\'s id. But that would be taking from the object itself. Wait, maybe the function is intended to take the item from the object it\'s located on. But if the item is already an object, then maybe the from_id is the object\'s id. But that seems like taking from the item itself, which is not correct. Maybe there\'s a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the from_id is the position, but the function\'s parameters don\'t accept positions. Wait, the function\'s parameters for take_from are what_id (the item\'s id) and from_id (the object\'s id or \'FLOOR\'). So in this case, the item is pepper_4, and the from_id is the object that contains it. But in the perception, pepper_4 is listed as an object with position (3.0,1.5). So maybe the from_id is "pepper_4"? But that would be taking from the object itself. That doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object that the item is on. But in this case, the item is not on another object; it\'s just an object in the room. So perhaps the from_id is "FLOOR". But the item is at (3.0,1.5), which is not the floor. Wait, the floor is probably the base of the room. So maybe the from_id is "FLOOR", but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object\'s id, which is pepper_4. But that\'s not correct. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me check the example in the perception. The table_6 has contents, but pepper_4 is listed as a separate object. So maybe the pepper_4 is on the floor, but its position is (3.0,1.5). But the floor is probably at y=0. So maybe the from_id is "FLOOR", but the position is (3.0,1.5). But the function\'s from_id is supposed to be the object\'s id or \'FLOOR\'. So if the item is on the floor, use \'FLOOR\'. But if the item is on another object, use that object\'s id. But in this case, the item is not on another object; it\'s just an object in the room. So maybe the from_id is "FLOOR". But that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object\'s id, which is pepper_4. But that would be taking from the object itself. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the function is designed to take the item from the object it\'s located on. But if the item is an object, then perhaps the from_id is the object\'s id. But that would be taking from the object, which is the item itself. That doesn\'t make sense. Maybe the function is intended to take the item from the object it\'s on, but in this case, the item is not on another object. So perhaps the from_id is "FLOOR". But the position is (3.0,1.5), which is not the floor. This is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to use the from_id as "pepper_4", but that\'s not correct. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object that the item is on, but in this case, the item is not on any object. So perhaps the from_id is "FLOOR". But the position is (3.0,1.5), which is not the floor. Hmm. Maybe the function is designed to take the item from the object it\'s located on, but if the item is not on any object, then the from_id is "FLOOR". So in this case, the correct from_id is "FLOOR". But the position is (3.0,1.5), but the function doesn\'t use the position, only the from_id. So the correct tool call would be take_from with what_id "pepper_4" and from_id "FLOOR". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object\'s id, which is pepper_4. But that would be taking from the object itself. That seems incorrect. Wait, the function\'s description says: "the id of the object B from which the item is taken or \'FLOOR\' for the floor". So if the item is on the floor, use \'FLOOR\'. If the item is on another object, use that object\'s id. But in this case, the item is not on another object; it\'s just an object in the room. So maybe the from_id is "FLOOR". But the position is (3.0,1.5), which is not the floor. But the function doesn\'t use the position, only the from_id. So the correct call would be take_from with what_id "pepper_4" and from_id "FLOOR". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the from_id is the object\'s id, which is pepper_4. But that would be taking from the object itself. That seems incorrect. Maybe the function is designed to take the item from the object it\'s located on, but in this case, the item is not on any object. So the from_id is "FLOOR". Therefore, the correct tool call is take_from with what_id "pepper_4" and from_id "FLOOR".\n</think>\n\n' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'created_at': '2025-12-09T00:15:23.801405712Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 379690004684, 'load_duration': 43640916, 'prompt_eval_count': 1340, 'prompt_eval_duration': 159938076, 'eval_count': 1932, 'eval_duration': 16080501478, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'qwen3:4b-q4_K_M', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--6e66a63f-123a-4ac2-88d9-ce8e7a297d2c-0' tool_calls=[{'name': 'take_from', 'args': {'from_id': 'FLOOR', 'what_id': 'pepper_4'}, 'id': 'b91e1b54-c7df-4486-94ac-abef30f97487', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1340, 'output_tokens': 1932, 'total_tokens': 3272}
