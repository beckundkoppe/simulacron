[action_imaginator] drop carrot

The goal is to drop the carrot on the table, as it is the only relevant object in the room. The user is at (0.5, 0.5) and the table is at (1.0, 4.0). Dropping the carrot requires being at the table's location, as movement is necessary to interact with the table. The minimal action sequence is to move to the table first, then drop the carrot. Therefore, the best next action is to move to the table.

\boxed{\text{move to table_3}} Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
