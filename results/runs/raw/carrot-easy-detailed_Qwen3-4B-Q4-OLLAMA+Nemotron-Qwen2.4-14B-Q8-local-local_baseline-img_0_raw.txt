The human agent can move, take and drop objects, and interact with objects (open, close, lock, unlock, go through or look through doors).

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer).

[action_imaginator] The user is at position (0.5, 0.5) and the table is at (1.0, 4.0). To place the carrot on the table, the user must first move to the table's position, as placing an object on a table requires proximity. The minimal action sequence is to move to the table and then place the carrot. Therefore, the next action is to move to the table.

\boxed{\text{go to table}}

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 5.0, "extend_y": 5.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "carrot", "id": "carrot_4"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_3", "position": "(1.0,4.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}]} Reasoning: The user is at position (0.5, 0.5) and the table is at (1.0, 4.0). To place the carrot on the table, the user must first move to the table's position, as placing an object on a table requires proximity. The minimal action sequence is to move to the table and then place the carrot. Therefore, the next action is to move to the table.

\boxed{\text{go to table}} Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
