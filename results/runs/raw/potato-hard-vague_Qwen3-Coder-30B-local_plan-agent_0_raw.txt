**Facts:**

[reflector] **Effects of Actions:**
- Moved from (0.0,2.0) to box_11
- Collected diamond_10 from box_11

**Facts:**
- Player is now in box_11
- Player has diamond_10 in inventory
- Previous location was (0.0,2.0)

**Assumptions about new state:**
- Box_11 contained diamond_10 (proved right)
- Movement to box_11 was successful (proved right)
- Player had valid access to box_11 (assumed, not verified)

**Assumptions proven right:**
- The diamond was actually in box_11
- The movement action was successful

- None explicitly stated, but assumed the player could move to box_11 and that it contained the diamond (both verified as correct)

- **Shelf at (0.0, 2.0)**: Contains an open, unlocked chest (empty)
- **Door at (0.0, 1.0)**: Open and unlocked
- **Box at (0.0, 0.0)**: Empty

**Relevant for goal:**
- The chest at (0.0, 2.0) is open and empty, so no new items there
- The door at (0.0, 1.0) is open, so I can move through it
- The box at (0.0, 0.0) is empty, so no new items there

**Inventory verification:**
- I have potato_9, diamond_5, diamond_10, and key_7
- No potato was placed on the table (the potato is in my inventory)
- No diamond was collected from box_11 (diamond_10 is already in inventory)
- No movement to box_11 occurred (I'm at (0.0, 0.0) in chamber)

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Action Effect:** Moved through door_8 from main area (1.0,1.0) to chamber (0.0,1.0)

**Facts:**
- Player is now at (0.0,1.0) in chamber
- Door at (0.0,1.0) is open and unlocked
- Chamber contains: empty chest, empty box

**Assumptions Proven Right:**
- Door accessibility and open state
- Successful movement execution

**Assumptions Proven Wrong:**
- None (no new assumptions beyond basic movement and door state)
