[reflector] **Facts after the move**

- The human is now at position (3 , 1.5).  
- Inventory is still empty.  
- All objects remain where they were (chest at (2,2), table at (3.5,0.5), peppers at (3.5,1.5), (3,1.5) and (3.5,1.0), apple at (3.5,1.6), potato at (0.5,1.5)).  
- No objects have been taken, dropped, or interacted with.

**Assumptions made before the move**

1. *I could reach (3, 1.5) in a single move.* – **Correct:** the system executed the move.  
2. *Moving does not alter any object positions or the inventory.* – **Correct:** nothing else changed.  
3. *The table is still empty and reachable from the new position.* – **Still valid** (no interaction yet).  
4. *The peppers are still at their original coordinates.* – **Correct** (no pick‑up actions performed).  

No assumptions were violated; the only effect of the action was the change in the human’s location.

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

- **Human** is at position (3 , 1.5).  
- **Inventory** now contains **pepper_4**.  
- **pepper_4** is no longer on the floor (its location is now “in inventory”).  
- All other objects are unchanged:

  - **chest_7** at (2.0, 2.0) (closed, unlocked, empty)

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. *Moving or taking an object does not move any other objects.* – **Correct**; all other objects stayed where they were.  
2. *The human can still reach the remaining peppers and the table from the current position.* – **Correct**; distances are within reach.  
3. *The inventory can hold the pepper.* – **Correct**; the pepper was successfully added.  
4. *Taking pepper_4 does not affect the apple or any other item.* – **Correct**; the apple remains at (3.5, 1.6).  

All assumptions made before the action proved to be right.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (drop pepper_4 on table_6)**  

- **Human** is at position (3.5, 0.5) (standing on the tile of the table).  
- **Inventory** is now empty.  
- **pepper_4** is on **table_6** (its location is “on table_6”).  
- **pepper_3** remains at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **pepper_5** remains at (3.5, 1.0).  
- **apple_9** remains at (3.5, 1.6).  
- **table_6** is still at (3.5, 0.5) and now holds **pepper_4**.  
- **chest_7** is at (2.0, 2.0), closed‑unlocked and empty.  
- **potato_8** is at (0.5, 1.5).  

**Assumptions about the new state**  

1. *Dropping an object places it on the target surface without moving any other objects.*  
2. *The human’s position does not change when dropping an item.*  
3. *The inventory is updated to remove the dropped object.*  
4. *All other objects (peppers, apple, chest, potato) stay where they were.*  

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**  

- Assumption 1 – **right** (pepper_4 is now on the table, nothing else moved).  
- Assumption 2 – **right** (human is still at (3.5, 0.5)).  
- Assumption 3 – **right** (inventory is empty).  
- Assumption 4 – **right** (all other objects unchanged).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action “take pepper_3”**

- Human is at position (3.5, 1.5).  
- Inventory now contains **pepper_3** (in addition to being empty before).  
- **pepper_3** is no longer on the floor; its location is “in inventory”.  
- **pepper_4** remains on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
- **pepper_5** is still on the floor at (3.5, 1.0).  
- **apple_9**, **potato_8**, **chest_7**, and **table_6** are unchanged.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. Taking an object only removes it from its floor position and adds it to the inventory.  
2. No other objects (including those on the table) are moved.  
3. The human’s position does not change when taking an object.  
4. The inventory can hold the newly taken pepper.

**Verification**

- Assumption 1 – **right** (pepper_3 is now in inventory).  
- Assumption 2 – **right** (pepper_4 stays on the table; pepper_5 unchanged).  
- Assumption 3 – **right** (human remains at (3.5, 1.5)).  
- Assumption 4 – **right** (pepper_3 successfully added to inventory).

### Assumptions made about the new state

1. **Dropping an object places it on the specified surface and does not move any other objects.**  
2. **The human’s position does not change when dropping an item.**  
3. **The inventory is updated to remove the dropped object.**  
4. **Objects already on the table (pepper 4) remain on the table.**  
5. **All other objects (pepper 5, apple, potato, chest) stay where they were.**

### Verification of assumptions

| Assumption | Outcome | Correct? |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | *pepper_3* is now on *table_6*; nothing else moved. | ✔️ |
| 2 | Human still at (3.5, 0.5). | ✔️ |
| 3 | Inventory is empty. | ✔️ |
| 4 | *pepper_4* stays on *table_6*. | ✔️ |
| 5 | *pepper_5*, *apple_9*, *potato_8*, *chest_7* unchanged. | ✔️ |

All assumptions proved **right**.  

**Goal status:** All three peppers (*pepper_3*, *pepper_4*, *pepper_5*) are now on the table except *pepper_5* which remains on the floor; only one more placement is needed.

| 2 | All other objects (pepper 3, 4, apple, potato, chest, table) stayed put. | ✔️ |

| 4 | Inventory now holds *pepper 5* without issue. | ✔️ |

**Goal status:**  
- *pepper 3* and *pepper 4* are already on the table.  
- *pepper 5* is now in the inventory, ready to be placed.  
Only one more action (“drop pepper_5 into table_6”) is needed to achieve **all peppers on the table**.
