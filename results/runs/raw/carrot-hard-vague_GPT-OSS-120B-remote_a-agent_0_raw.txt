[observer] - I’m at (0.5, 0.5) in the “main” room.  
- My inventory contains a carrot (carrot_4).  
- There is a table (table_3) at (1.0, 4.0) and its contents are empty.  

These facts are directly relevant for placing the carrot on the table.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the executed action**

- **Fact added:** Your position is now at the location of `table_3` (≈ (1.0, 4.0)).
- **Fact unchanged:** The carrot (`carrot_4`) is still in your inventory.
- **Fact unchanged:** `table_3`’s contents remain empty.

**Assumptions made before the action**

| Assumption | Intended effect | Proven right? |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| You could move directly to the table’s location. | You would end up “at” the table. | ✅ Yes – the move succeeded. |
| Moving does not affect inventory or table contents. | Carrot stays in inventory; table stays empty. | ✅ Yes – both remain unchanged. |
| After moving, you would be able to place the carrot next. | Position ready for a “place” action. | ✅ Yes – you are now at the table, but the carrot has not yet been placed. |

**What was NOT achieved**

- The carrot has not been placed on the table yet; it is still in your inventory. A subsequent “place carrot on table” action is needed.

[observer] **Observation:**  
- I am at position (1.0, 4.0) – the location of `table_3`.

- `table_3` is empty.  

These are the relevant facts for placing the carrot on the table.
