[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5,1.5). This is the key fact needed to proceed. The table is at (3.5,0.5), so you will need to move to the cucumber's position first.

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Moved to the cucumber's location (3.5,1.5).  

**Facts:**  
- Cucumber is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5,0.5).  
- Agent is now at (3.5,1.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
1. Cucumber is pickable here.  
2. No obstacles block movement to the table.  

**Validation:**  
- Assumption 1 is correct (agent can pick up the cucumber).  
- Assumption 2 is likely correct (no obstacles mentioned).  

**Next Steps:**  
Pick up cucumber → Move to table (3.5,0.5) → Place cucumber on table.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
Picked up the cucumber. Agent now holds the cucumber; cucumber is no longer at (3.5,1.5).  

**Facts:**  
- Cucumber is with the agent (held).  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5,0.5) and empty.  

**Assumptions:**  
1. Cucumber is pickable (validated as correct).  
2. No obstacles block movement to the table (validated as likely correct).  

**Validation:**  
- Assumption 1: Confirmed (cucumber was successfully picked up).  
- Assumption 2: Still holds (no obstacles mentioned).  

**Next Step:** Move to table (3.5,0.5) to place the cucumber.
