[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
- Agent moved successfully to (3.5,1.5), the cucumber's location.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is now at the cucumber's position.  
- Cucumber is present here (assumed).  

**Assumptions:**  
- No obstacles blocked the path.  
- Cucumber is pickable here.  

**Validation:**  
- Assumption about cucumber's location was correct (movement succeeded).  
- No evidence of errors yet.  

Next steps: Pick up cucumber → move to table (3.5,0.5).

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Action:**  
- Cucumber picked up successfully.  
- Agent now holds the cucumber.  

**Facts:**  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5) (cucumber's original position).  
- Cucumber is no longer present here (picked up).  
- Agent is carrying the cucumber.  

**Assumptions about new state:**  
- Cucumber was pickable (confirmed).  
- No obstacles block movement to table (assumed).  
- Table remains empty and accessible (assumed).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber pickability was correct (action succeeded).  
- Table accessibility remains valid (no obstacles reported).  

**Next Steps:** Move to table (3.5,0.5) → place cucumber on table.
