[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- **Human**: now at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **Cucumber**: still at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **Table**: still at (3.5, 0.5) and empty.  
- **Cucumber on table**: still false.  
- **Human holding cucumber**: still false.

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Moving to the cucumber’s location will allow the cucumber to be placed on the table | **Wrong** – the cucumber remains where it was; the goal is not achieved. |
| The cucumber’s position does not change when the human moves | **Right** – cucumber stays at (3.5, 1.5). |
| The table remains empty unless an object is explicitly placed on it | **Right** – table is still empty. |

**Summary**  
The action only moved the human; it did not pick up or place the cucumber. The cucumber remains above the table, and the table remains empty. The goal “place the cucumber on the table” has not been achieved.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved to (3.5, 1.5) and picked up the cucumber.  
- Cucumber is now *held* by the human (its location is now “in hand”).  
- Table at (3.5, 0.5) remains empty.  

**Facts in the new state**

| Object | Location / Status |
|--------|-------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Cucumber | *in hand* (not on the table) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5), empty |
| Cucumber on table | **false** |
| Human holding cucumber | **true** |

|------------|---------|
| Moving to the cucumber’s location allows the cucumber to be placed on the table | **Wrong** – the cucumber is still not on the table. |
| The cucumber’s position does not change when the human moves | **Right** – cucumber stays at (3.5, 1.5) until picked up. |
| The table remains empty unless an object is explicitly placed on it | **Right** – table is still empty. |
| Picking up the cucumber will enable placing it on the table later | **Right** – the cucumber is now held and can be placed. |

**Summary**

The action succeeded in picking up the cucumber, but the goal “place the cucumber on the table” has not yet been achieved. The cucumber is held by the human, and the table remains empty.

**Summary**

The human has moved to the cucumber and picked it up. The cucumber is now in hand, the table remains empty, and the goal “place the cucumber on the table” has not yet been achieved. All assumptions about movement, object state, and table status proved correct.
