**Assumptions made**

1. The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. Moving to that coordinate is possible and will bring the human to the cucumber.  
3. No other actions (pick‑up, place) were performed in this step.

**What proved right / wrong**

- **Right**: The cucumber is indeed at (3.5, 1.5); the human successfully moved there.  
- **Wrong**: The cucumber was not picked up, and it was not placed on the table. Those actions remain pending.

[reflector] **Facts after the move**

| Object | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Cucumber | *in inventory* |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Potato | (0.5, 1.5) |
| Wooden chest | (2.0, 2.0), closed |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The human’s movement to (3.5, 0.5) does not alter the cucumber’s inventory status.  
2. The table remains at (3.5, 0.5) and is unchanged.  
3. No other objects (potato, chest) are affected by the move.  
4. No pick‑up or place action was performed during this step.

**What proved right / wrong**

- **Right**:  
  - Human is now at (3.5, 0.5).  
  - Cucumber remains in the human’s inventory.  
  - Table stays at (3.5, 0.5).  
  - Potato and chest remain where they were.

- **Wrong**:  
  - The cucumber was **not** placed on the table (no place action executed).  
  - No other unintended changes occurred.
