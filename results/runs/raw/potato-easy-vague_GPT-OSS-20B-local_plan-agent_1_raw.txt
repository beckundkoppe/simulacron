Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human agent moved from the starting location (0.0, 0.0) to the location of `table_5`.  
- No object was moved or placed; the potato remains wherever it was before the action (unknown, but not on the table).

**Facts in the new state**

1. Human is at `table_5`.  
2. Potato is not on the table (user reports “I see no potato in the room”).  
3. The potato’s location is still unknown; it is not in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions made and their validity**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The potato was in the human’s inventory and would be placed on the table when the human moved there. | **Wrong** – the potato was not placed. |
| The potato was present in the room and would be visible on the table after the move. | **Wrong** – the user reports no potato in the room. |

Thus, the action only changed the human’s position; it did not achieve the goal of placing a potato on the table.

1. Human is at `door_6` (coordinates 4.0, 4.0).  
2. `door_6` is open.  
3. Key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
4. Table at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.  
5. No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions made**

- The door at (4.0, 4.0) was open and could be entered.  
- The human’s movement to the door is possible and does not alter other objects.

**Assumptions verified**

- Both assumptions are correct: the door was open, and the human successfully moved to it without affecting other items.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

No action was taken – the “Result: .” indicates an empty action sequence.  
Therefore the environment state is unchanged from the description you gave.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at the open door location (4.0, 4.0).  
2. The door at (4.0, 4.0) is open.  
3. A key is at (3.0, 1.0).  
4. The table at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.  
5. No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions**

None were made, because no action was executed.

**Assumptions proved**

N/A – there were no assumptions to test.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

No action was taken, so the environment remains exactly as you described.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at the open door (4.0, 4.0).  
2. The table at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.  
3. No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.  
4. A key is at (3.0, 1.0).  
5. The door at (4.0, 4.0) is open.

**Assumptions made**

- The potato is not in the room (or at least not visible).  
- The potato is not in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions proved**

Both assumptions are correct: the potato is absent from the room and the inventory.

---

**Next step**

To place a potato on the table, we first need to locate the potato.  
Please let me know where the potato is (or if it’s hidden somewhere) so I can pick it up and put it on the table.

[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- The human moved from the table at (0.0, 3.0) to the location of `door_6` (4.0, 4.0).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or interacted with.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at `door_6` (4.0, 4.0).  
2. The door at (4.0, 4.0) remains open.  
3. The key is still at (3.0, 1.0).  
4. The table at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.  
5. No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions made**

- Moving to the door does not alter the state of other objects.  
- The door is open and can be entered.  
- The potato remains absent.

**Assumptions proved**

All of the above assumptions are correct; the action only changed the human’s location.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 3.0) to the location of `table_5`.  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or interacted with.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at `table_5`.  
2. Potato is not on the table (and is not in the human’s inventory).  
3. Key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
4. Door at (4.0, 4.0) is open.  
5. No potato is present in the room.

**Assumptions made**

- The potato was not in the human’s inventory.  
- Moving to the table does not alter the state of other objects.

**Assumptions proved**

Both assumptions are correct; the action only changed the human’s location.

[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 1.0).  
- No objects were moved, picked up, or interacted with.

**Current facts**

1. Human is at (3.0, 1.0).  
2. The key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
3. The table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
4. The door at (4.0, 4.0) is open.  
5. No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions made**

- Moving to the key’s location does not automatically pick up the key.  
- The key stays at (3.0, 1.0).  
- No other objects or states changed.

**Assumptions proved**

All of the above assumptions are correct; the only change is the human’s new location.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**  
The human’s location changed from the starting point (0.0, 3.0) to the table at (0.0, 3.0) (table_5). No objects were moved or interacted with.

**Facts**  
- Human is now at table_5 (0.0, 3.0).  
- Key remains at (3.0, 1.0).  
- Door at (4.0, 4.0) is open/unlocked.  
- Table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
- No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.

**Assumptions**  
- Moving to a location does not automatically pick up objects.  
- The table remains empty until a potato is placed.  
- The potato is absent (not in the room or inventory).

**Assumptions proved**  
All of the above assumptions are correct – the only state change was the human’s new location.

[observer] No new discoveries. The perception confirms the door at (4, 4) is open/unlocked, the key at (3, 1), and the table at (0, 3) remains empty.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**  
The only change was the human’s location – it moved from the key’s spot (3, 1) to the table at (0, 3). No objects were picked up or placed.

**Current facts**  
- Door at (4, 4) is open/unlocked.  
- Key remains at (3, 1).  
- Table at (0, 3) is still empty.  
- No potato is present in the room or in the human’s inventory.  
- Human is now at the table (0, 3).

**Assumptions made**  
- Moving to a location does not automatically pick up objects.  
- The table stays empty until a potato is placed.  
- The potato is absent.
