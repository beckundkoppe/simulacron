Main goal: Place the cucumber on the table.
Replanning because Main goal is not yet reached. Create an initial plan

            Based on the current contex: Create a structured plan to reach the goal.
            

[planner] **Initial Plan:**
1. **Move to the counter** (assuming the cucumber is there).  
2. **Take the cucumber** from the counter.  
3. **Move to the table**.  
4. **Place the cucumber** on the table.  

This sequence assumes the cucumber is on the counter. Adjustments may be needed if the cucumber is located elsewhere (e.g., fridge, cabinet), but this is the minimal action plan based on typical scenarios.

Perception: {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 2.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}}, "your_inventory": [], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_4", "position": "(3.5,0.5)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "cucumber", "id": "cucumber_3", "position": "(3.5,1.5)"}]}
What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your current plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5,1.5), and the table is at (3.5,0.5). The cucumber is not on the counter (no counter detected in perception). Adjust the plan to move directly to the cucumber's position first.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to (3.5,1.5) to pick up the cucumber.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to (3.5,1.5) [cucumber's position] and collected `cucumber_3`.  

**Facts:**  
- Cucumber is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5,0.5).  
- Cucumber is now in hand.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The cucumber was not on the counter (correct, as no counter was detected).  
- Direct movement to the cucumber’s position suffices (confirmed).  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- The cucumber’s location was correctly identified.  
- No need to interact with a non-existent counter.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Move to (3.5,0.5) [table’s position].  
2. Place the cucumber on the table.

Question: The current plan is not completed because: The goal is not yet reached. The cucumber has been collected but not placed on the table. The next step (moving to the table and placing the cucumber) remains unexecuted.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, the adjusted plan remains promising. The cucumber is already collected, and the next steps (moving to the table and placing it) are direct and minimal. No obstacles or additional steps are required, so the plan is valid and will achieve the goal.

Question: The current plan is not completed because: The goal is not yet completed. The agent has moved to the table's position and is holding the cucumber, but the final action of placing the cucumber on the table has not been executed. Once this action is performed, the goal will be achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, the plan remains promising. The agent is already at the table's position with the cucumber in hand. The final step—placing the cucumber on the table—is straightforward and requires no additional actions (e.g., opening drawers, moving obstacles). Executing this action will directly achieve the goal. No further adjustments or discoveries are needed.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your current plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] The table at (3.5,0.5) is empty (contents_count: "empty"), and you are already positioned at the table. No additional actions required—simply place the cucumber on the table.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Place the cucumber on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
