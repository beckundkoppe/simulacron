[observer] I observe a table at position (0.0,4.0) that is currently empty. I also see a key at position (3.0,1.0) and a box at position (1.0,1.0) containing a diamond.

[reflector] **Facts:**
- Agent moved from (0.0,0.0) to key_7 location
- Agent collected key_7
- Agent moved from (3.0,1.0) to door_8 location
- Door_8 was already unlocked
- Agent went through door_8 into chamber

**Assumptions made:**
- Key_7 would be useful for unlocking door_8 (proven wrong - door was already unlocked)
- Agent needed to collect key_7 before reaching door_8 (proven wrong - key wasn't needed)
- Door_8 was locked and required key_7 (proven wrong - it was already unlocked)

**What proved right:**
- Agent successfully navigated to key_7 and collected it
- Agent successfully went through door_8 into chamber

**What proved wrong:**
- The key collection was unnecessary for opening the door
- The agent's path planning assumed the key would be needed, but it wasn't required
