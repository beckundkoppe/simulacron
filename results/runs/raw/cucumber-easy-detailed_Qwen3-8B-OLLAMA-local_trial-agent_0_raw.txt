Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [288] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The high-level goal requires three distinct sub-tasks ("find," "pick up," "place") that need explicit breakdown into actionable steps (e.g., navigating to locations, interacting with objects). Without decomposition, the plan lacks specificity for execution. 

**Answer:** No, the plan tree needs to be split into individual actions (e.g., "move to [location]," "pick up cucumber," "put on table") to enable execution.

Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan Tree:**
1. **[Find cucumber]**  
   - Search the room (e.g., check fridge, countertop, shelves) to locate the cucumber.  
2. **[Take cucumber]**  
   - Pick up the cucumber from its location.  
3. **[Go to table]**  
   - Navigate to the table's location.  
4. **[Put cucumber on table]**  
   - Place the cucumber on the table.  

**Key Decomposition:**  
- Breaks the goal into sequential, actionable steps.  
- Ensures the agent first locates the cucumber, then interacts with it, and finally places it on the table.  
- Assumes the table is a distinct location; adjust navigation steps if the table is already adjacent.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed for execution. Each step (find, take, navigate to table, place) represents actionable primitives. While "find cucumber" and "go to table" could benefit from environmental context (e.g., location cues), the plan assumes the agent can infer or navigate to the cucumber's location and the table. The decomposition avoids unnecessary substeps, aligning with the "minimal action sequence" requirement. Execution can proceed with these steps as high-level commands. 

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is decomposed sufficiently to start execution.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Place the cucumber on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
