Goal: Collect all Peppers, then place all of the peppers on the table.
Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan only states the high‑level goal (“collect all peppers, then place them on the table”) but does not break it down into the concrete steps the agent must take (e.g., locate each pepper, move to it, pick it up, carry it to the table, and drop it). Since execution requires those actionable sub‑steps, the plan isn’t sufficiently decomposed yet. Therefore, we should first expand the plan into the necessary low‑level actions before starting execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan**

1. **Locate peppers** – Scan the room for every “Pepper” object.  
2. **Collect peppers** – For each pepper found:  
   a. Move to the pepper’s location.  
   b. `take` the pepper. (repeat until all peppers are in inventory)  
3. **Locate the table** – Identify the position of the “Table” object.  
4. **Place peppers on the table** – While inventory contains peppers:  
   a. Move to the table.  
   b. `put` a pepper on the table. (repeat until the inventory is empty)  

*No extra actions (e.g., opening doors) are added unless a pepper or the table is behind a closed door; in that case insert an `open` before moving through.*

- No peppers have been picked up or moved yet; all three peppers remain where they were.  
- The table **table_6** is still at (3.5, 0.5) and is empty.  

**Assumptions made before the move**  
1. *Pepper 5 is at (3.5, 1.0).* – **Correct**; the movement placed the human exactly there.  
2. *The human can reach that coordinate without obstruction.* – **Correct**; the move succeeded.  
3. *Moving to the pepper does not automatically pick it up.* – **Correct**; the pepper is still on the floor.  

No assumptions turned out false; the only effect so far is the change in the human’s position.

- **Assumptions made**
  1. The human can pick up a pepper while standing on its tile. – **Correct** (the pick‑up succeeded).
  2. Picking up the pepper removes it from the floor and places it in the human’s inventory. – **Correct**.
  3. No other objects or obstacles interfere with the pick‑up. – **Correct**.
  4. The human can hold at least one object (pepper 5) while still being able to move. – **Correct**.

All assumptions proved right; the only change is that pepper 5 is now being carried.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move to pepper_3)**  

- **Human position:** (3.5, 1.5) – the tile where **pepper_3** is located.  
- **Inventory:** still holding **pepper_5** (picked up earlier).  
- **pepper_3:** still lying on the floor at (3.5, 1.5).  
- **pepper_4:** unchanged at (3.0, 1.5).  
- **table_6:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5) and still empty.  

**Assumptions made for this step**  

1. The human can move while carrying an object. – **Correct** (the move succeeded).  
2. No obstacle blocks the path from (3.5, 1.0) to (3.5, 1.5). – **Correct** (the move succeeded).  
3. Arriving on a tile that contains an object does not automatically pick it up. – **Correct** (pepper_3 is still on the floor).  

All assumptions held true; the only change is the human’s location. The next steps will be to pick up **pepper_3**, then collect **pepper_4**, and finally place all three peppers on **table_6**.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
- The human is still standing on pepper 3, which has not been picked up.  
- Pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- The table is empty; no peppers have been placed on it yet.  

Therefore the goal of collecting all peppers and placing them on the table has **not** been achieved.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the action “collect pepper_3”**

- **Facts**
  - Human is standing at (3.5, 1.5) – the tile where pepper 3 was.
  - Inventory now contains **pepper_5** (picked up earlier) **and pepper_3** (just picked up).
  - **pepper_3** is no longer on the floor; its former tile is now empty.
  - **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).
  - **table_6** is still at (3.5, 0.5) and is empty.

- **Assumptions made**
  1. The human can pick up a pepper while already holding another object. → **Correct** (pepper 3 was added to the inventory).
  2. Picking up the pepper removes it from the floor. → **Correct** (pepper 3 is no longer at its location).
  3. No other objects or obstacles block the pick‑up at (3.5, 1.5). → **Correct** (the action succeeded).
  4. The human’s position does not change when picking up an object. → **Correct** (still at (3.5, 1.5)).

All assumptions proved accurate; the only change is that the human now holds both peppers 5 and 3, and pepper 3 has been cleared from the floor.

[observer] **Observations**

- I am standing at (3.5, 1.5).  
- My inventory now holds **pepper_5** and **pepper_3**.  
- **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- **table_6** is at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.

**Relevance** – The next steps are to collect the remaining pepper (pepper_4) and then place all three peppers onto the table.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not completed**.  
- You have already collected pepper 5 and pepper 3, but pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Additionally, none of the peppers have been placed on the table yet.  

Therefore the collection step is still pending (pepper 4) and the placement step has not been performed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is **not completed**.  
- You have already collected pepper 5 and pepper 3, but pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Additionally, none of the peppers have been placed on the table yet.  

Therefore the collection step is still pending (pepper 4) and the placement step has not been performed.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The agent has already picked up two of the three peppers, changing the state and moving closer to the goal. The remaining step—collecting pepper 4 and then placing all peppers on the table—has not been attempted yet, so the plan is still making progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.  
The agent has already picked up two of the three peppers, changing the state and moving closer to the goal. The remaining step—collecting pepper 4 and then placing all peppers on the table—has not been attempted yet, so the plan is still making progress.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the action “move to pepper_4”**

- **Facts after the move**
  - **Human position:** (3.0, 1.5) – the tile where **pepper_4** is located.  
  - **Inventory:** still holding **pepper_5** and **pepper_3** (no change).  
  - **pepper_4:** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5); it has **not** been picked up yet.  
  - **pepper_3:** no longer on the floor (now in inventory).  
  - **pepper_5:** no longer on the floor (now in inventory).  
  - **table_6:** unchanged at (3.5, 0.5) and still empty.

- **Assumptions made for this step**
  1. The human can walk while carrying one or more objects. → **Correct** (the move succeeded).  
  2. There are no obstacles blocking the path from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.0, 1.5). → **Correct** (the move succeeded).  
  3. Arriving on a tile that contains an object does **not** automatically pick it up. → **Correct** (pepper_4 is still on the floor).  
  4. The human’s inventory does not affect the ability to occupy the same tile as an object. → **Correct** (the human stands on the pepper’s tile).

All assumptions held true; the only change is the human’s location. The next required step is to **pick up pepper_4** and then **place all three peppers (pepper_5, pepper_3, pepper_4) onto table_6**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the plan is not yet completed.

**Reasoning:**  
- You have already collected *pepper 5* and *pepper 3*, but *pepper 4* is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- The inventory currently holds only *pepper 5* and *pepper 3*.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty; none of the peppers have been placed on it.  

Therefore, you still need to pick up *pepper 4* and then put all three peppers onto the table.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the plan is not yet completed.

**Reasoning:**  
- You have already collected *pepper 5* and *pepper 3*, but *pepper 4* is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
- The inventory currently holds only *pepper 5* and *pepper 3*.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty; none of the peppers have been placed on it.  

Therefore, you still need to pick up *pepper 4* and then put all three peppers onto the table.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent has already collected pepper 5 and pepper 3, moved to the location of pepper 4, and is ready to pick it up before placing all three on the table. This is a clear progression toward the goal and not a redundant or stalled sequence.

Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected pepper_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the action “collect pepper_4”**

**Facts after the action**

- **Human position:** (3.0, 1.5) – the tile where pepper 4 was.
- **Inventory:** now holds **pepper_5**, **pepper_3**, and **pepper_4**.
- **pepper_4:** no longer on the floor; its former tile is empty.
- **pepper_3** and **pepper_5:** already in the inventory (as before).
- **table_6:** still at (3.5, 0.5) and remains empty.

**Assumptions made for this step**

1. The human can pick up a pepper while already holding two other objects.  
2. Picking up the pepper removes it from the floor and adds it to the inventory.  
3. Standing on a tile that contains an object does not prevent the pick‑up.  
4. The human’s position does not change when an object is picked up.

**Verification**

All four assumptions proved **correct** – the pick‑up succeeded, the pepper disappeared from the floor, the inventory now contains three peppers, and the human stayed at (3.0, 1.5).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observations**

- I am standing at (3.0, 1.5).  
- My inventory now holds **pepper_5**, **pepper_3**, and **pepper_4**.  
- The floor at (3.0, 1.5) is empty (pepper_4 was picked up).  
- **table_6** is at (3.5, 0.5) and is still empty.  

**Relevance** – The remaining task is to place the three peppers I am carrying onto the empty table.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes.  
All three peppers (pepper 5, pepper 3 and pepper 4) have been picked up and are now in the human’s inventory, so the “collect‑all‑peppers” part of the plan is finished. (The subsequent step of placing them on the table still remains.)

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Yes.  
All three peppers (pepper 5, pepper 3 and pepper 4) have been picked up and are now in the human’s inventory, so the “collect‑all‑peppers” part of the plan is finished. (The subsequent step of placing them on the table still remains.)

Plan:
Locate the table
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve minimal plan**

1. **move to table_6**                  *(go to the tile (3.5, 0.5) where the table is located)*  
2. **place pepper_5 on table_6**           *(drop the first pepper onto the table)*  
3. **place pepper_3 on table_6**          *(drop the second pepper onto the table)*  
4. **place pepper_4 on table_6**          *(drop the third pepper onto the table)*  

After these four actions the human is still at the table and all three peppers are on the table, satisfying the goal.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move to table_6)**  

- **Human position:** (3.5, 0.5) – the tile occupied by **table_6**.  
- **Inventory:** holds **pepper_5**, **pepper_3**, **pepper_4**.  
- **pepper_5**, **pepper_3**, **pepper_4:** no longer on the floor.  
- **table_6:** still empty (no objects have been placed on it yet).  

**Assumptions made for this move**  

1. The human can walk while carrying three objects.  
2. There are no obstacles between (3.0, 1.5) and (3.5, 0.5).  
3. **table_6** is correctly located at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. The human may occupy the same tile as a table (standing on it).  

**Verification**  

- All four assumptions proved correct – the move succeeded, the human arrived at the table’s coordinates while still holding all three peppers, and the table remains empty.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Yes, the plan is complete.  
We have already identified the table’s location – it is at coordinates (3.5, 0.5). No further “search‑for‑table” actions are needed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the action “drop pepper_5 into table_6”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human position | (3.5, 0.5) – standing on the tile of **table_6** |
| Inventory | now holds **pepper_3** and **pepper_4** (pepper 5 removed) |
| **pepper_5** location | on **table_6** (at (3.5, 0.5)) |
| **pepper_3** location | still in inventory |
| **pepper_4** location | still in inventory |
| **table_6** contents | contains **pepper_5** (no longer empty) |
| Other objects | unchanged (no other objects in the room) |

**Assumptions made for this step**

1. *The table can accept an object.* – **Correct** (pepper 5 was placed on it).  
2. *Dropping an object removes it from the human’s inventory.* – **Correct** (pepper 5 no longer in inventory).  
3. *The human’s position does not change when dropping an object.* – **Correct** (still at (3.5, 0.5)).  
4. *The object stays on the table after being dropped.* – **Correct** (pepper 5 is now on the table).  

All assumptions proved true; the only change is that **pepper_5** is now on **table_6** while the human still carries **pepper_3** and **pepper_4**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The goal is to have **all three peppers** on **table_6**.  

- You have already placed **pepper 5** on the table.  
- You are still holding **pepper 3** and **pepper 4** in your inventory, and they have not been dropped onto the table yet.  

Therefore the plan is **not completed**; two peppers still need to be placed on the table.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The goal is to have **all three peppers** on **table_6**.  

- You have already placed **pepper 5** on the table.  
- You are still holding **pepper 3** and **pepper 4** in your inventory, and they have not been dropped onto the table yet.  

Therefore the plan is **not completed**; two peppers still need to be placed on the table.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising – the peppers have been collected and one (pepper 5) is already on the table, and the remaining peppers (pepper 3 and pepper 4) are still in inventory ready to be placed. Recent actions have changed the state (dropping pepper 5), so progress toward the goal is continuing. 

**Answer: yes**.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The plan is still promising – the peppers have been collected and one (pepper 5) is already on the table, and the remaining peppers (pepper 3 and pepper 4) are still in inventory ready to be placed. Recent actions have changed the state (dropping pepper 5), so progress toward the goal is continuing.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The plan is still promising – the peppers have been collected and one (pepper 5) is already on the table, and the remaining peppers (pepper 3 and pepper 4) are still in inventory ready to be placed. Recent actions have changed the state (dropping pepper 5), so progress toward the goal is continuing.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped pepper_3 into table_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (drop pepper_3 into table_6)**  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Human position | (3.5, 0.5) – standing on the tile of **table_6** |
| Inventory | now holds only **pepper_4** (pepper 3 removed) |
| **pepper_5** location | on **table_6** (at (3.5, 0.5)) |
| **pepper_3** location | on **table_6** (at (3.5, 0.5)) |
| **pepper_4** location | still in the human’s inventory |
| **table_6** contents | contains **pepper_5** and **pepper_3** (no longer empty) |
| Other objects | unchanged (none) |

**Assumptions that were made for this drop**

1. *The table can accept another object while already holding one.* – **Correct** (pepper 3 was placed on the table that already had pepper 5).  
2. *Dropping an object removes it from the human’s inventory.* – **Correct** (pepper 3 is no longer in the inventory).  
3. *The human’s position does not change when dropping an object.* – **Correct** (still at (3.5, 0.5)).  
4. *The object stays on the table after being dropped.* – **Correct** (pepper 3 now resides on the table).  

All four assumptions proved true; the only change is the addition of **pepper_3** to **table_6** and the removal of it from the inventory.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The table already has pepper 5 and pepper 3, but **pepper 4** is still in the inventory. Since one pepper remains to be placed on the table, the plan is not yet finished. You need to drop pepper 4 onto table 6.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The table already has pepper 5 and pepper 3, but **pepper 4** is still in the inventory. Since one pepper remains to be placed on the table, the plan is not yet finished. You need to drop pepper 4 onto table 6.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The table already holds two peppers and the remaining pepper (pepper 4) is still in the inventory. The next required step is simply to drop pepper 4 onto the table, after which the goal will be achieved. No useless repetitions have occurred, and progress toward the plan is still possible.
