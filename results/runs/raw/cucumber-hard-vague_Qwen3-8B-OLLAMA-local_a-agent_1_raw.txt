[observer] The cucumber is located at (3.5,1.5), which is vertically aligned with the table (3.5,0.5) but not placed on it. The table is empty. The chest is closed but unlocked.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.5,1.5)
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber is collected by the agent.  
- Agent is at (3.5,1.5).  
- Table is empty and at (3.5,0.5).  

**Assumptions:**  
- Agent can move to the table’s position (3.5,0.5) to place the cucumber.  
- No obstacles block movement or placement.  

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- Collecting the cucumber was successful (confirmed by "collected cucumber_3").  
**Unvalidated Assumptions:**  
- Whether the agent can directly place the cucumber on the table without additional steps (e.g., moving to the table’s location).
