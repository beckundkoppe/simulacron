Main goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Replanning because Main goal is not yet reached. Create an initial plan

            Based on the current contex: Create a structured plan to reach the goal.
            

[planner] **Plan to place the carrot from inventory on the table**

1. **Move to the table** – navigate (walk/turn) until the human is standing next to the table.  
2. **Drop the carrot** – execute the “drop” (or “place”) action for the carrot while standing at the table.  

*These two steps constitute the minimal action sequence required to achieve the goal.*

[observer] I see that I’m in the “main” room at position (0.5, 0.5). My inventory contains a carrot (carrot_4). There is a table (table_3) located at (1.0, 4.0) and it’s currently empty. This confirms I need to move toward the table before dropping the carrot.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,1)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

- Human position: now at **(0.5, 1.0)** (moved one step north from the start).
- Inventory: still contains **carrot_4** (it has not been dropped yet).
- Table: **table_3** remains at **(1.0, 4.0)** and is still empty.
- No obstacles were encountered during the move, so the step succeeded.

**Assumptions made**

- *Assumption:* Moving north by one unit is allowed and does not collide with anything. → **Correct** (the move succeeded).
- *Assumption:* The carrot stays in the inventory until a drop action is issued. → **Correct** (the carrot is still carried).

**What remains**

- The human still needs to continue toward the table (approximately 4 units east and 3 units north from the current location) and then execute a **drop** (or place) action to put **carrot_4** on **table_3**.

- **Table:** **table_3** remains at **(1.0, 4.0)** and is still empty.

**Assumptions made**

- *Moving north by one unit is allowed* → **proved correct** (the step succeeded).
- *The carrot stays in the inventory until a drop action* → **proved correct** (carrot is still carried).
- *The table’s location and emptiness are unchanged* → **remains valid** (no interaction yet).

All assumptions hold; the only remaining work is to continue toward the table and then drop the carrot.

Reasoning: No — the carrot is still in the inventory and the human is at (0.5, 2.0), which is not adjacent to the table at (1.0, 4.0). The move‑to‑table step is unfinished and the drop action has not been performed, so the goal has not been reached.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[user] 
Main goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Replanning because The current state is at (0.5, 2.0) and the table is at (1.0, 4.0). Moving north twice will reach (0.5, 4.0), which is still not adjacent to the table (still one unit west). An additional east move is required before the drop action can succeed. Therefore the proposed plan of just two north moves followed by a drop will not achieve the goal, so the plan is not promising in its current form.

            Based on the current contex: Create a structured plan to reach the goal.
            

[planner] **Goal:** Place *carrot_4* from the inventory onto *table_3*.

**Current state**
- Human position: (0.5, 2.0)  
- Inventory: carrot_4  
- Table table_3 location: (1.0, 4.0) (empty)

**Minimal action sequence**

| Step | Action | Resulting position / state |
|------|--------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **move east** | (1.0, 2.0) |
| 2 | **move north** | (1.0, 2.5) |
| 3 | **move north** | (1.0, 3.0) |
| 4 | **move north** | (1.0, 3.5) |
| 5 | **move north** | (1.0, 4.0) – now standing on the table’s tile |
| 6 | **drop carrot_4** onto **table_3** | carrot_4 is no longer in inventory; it is on table_3 |

These six actions are the shortest possible sequence that gets the human next to the table and places the carrot on it. No extra moves or interactions are performed.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your current plan step? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] Perception confirms:

- Human at (0.5, 2.0) with **carrot_4** in inventory.  
- Table **table_3** remains at (1.0, 4.0) and is empty.  
- The tile directly east at (1.0, 2.0) is clear—no obstacles or objects.  

No changes from the previous state other than confirming the eastward path is free.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] move east

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
