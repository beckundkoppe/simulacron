[observer] I observe three peppers scattered in the room:  
- **pepper_3** at (3.5,1.5)  
- **pepper_5** at (3.5,1.0)  
- **pepper_4** at (3.0,1.5)  

The **table** at (3.5,0.5) is empty and positioned below two of the peppers. All peppers are reachable from the starting position.

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Pepper_5 is now on the table.  
- Peppers_3 and_4 remain scattered in the room.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The actions placed **all** peppers on the table (assumed to be true).  
- The table's position allows direct access to peppers_3 and_4 (assumed to be true).  

**Proven Wrong:**  
- The assumption that all peppers were placed on the table was **incorrect** (only pepper_5 was dropped).  
- The table's position may not directly access peppers_3 and_4 (requires further movement).  

**Next Steps:**  
Collect peppers_3 and_4, then move to the table to drop them.

[observer] I observe that **pepper_5** is already on the table, but **peppers_3** and **4** are still scattered. The table is at (3.5,0.5), and I am positioned here.
