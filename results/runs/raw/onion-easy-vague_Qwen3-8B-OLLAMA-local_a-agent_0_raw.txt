- Moved to (4,3.25) → opened door_15 → exited to hallway (outside).

- Onion successfully delivered to compost.

  - Initial assumption that door_15 was closed (it was already open).  

**Summary:**  
The task is complete. The onion is in the compost, door_15 was already open, and the compost’s location was correctly assumed.

- Onion_3 is in the compost.  
- Door_15 is open.  
- Compost is adjacent to Door_15.  

**Assumptions About the New State:**  
1. **Door_15 was closed** (initial assumption).  
2. **Compost location was correctly assumed** (adjacent to Door_15).  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Door_15 was closed** → **Proven wrong** (it was already open).  
- **Compost location** → **Proven correct** (adjacent to Door_15).  

**Summary:**  
Task complete. Onion is in compost. Door_15 was already open, and compost location was correctly assumed.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Onion_3 was successfully dropped into the compost.  

**Facts:**  
- Onion_3 is in the compost.  
- Door_15 is open.

**Assumptions About the New State:**  
1. **Door_15 was closed** (initial assumption).  
2. **Compost location was correctly assumed** (adjacent to Door_15).  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Door_15 was closed** → **Proven wrong** (it was already open).

**Summary:** Task complete. Onion in compost. Door was already open; compost location correct.
