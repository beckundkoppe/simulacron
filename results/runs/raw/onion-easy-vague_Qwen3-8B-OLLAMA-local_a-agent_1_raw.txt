[observer] You observe that **door_16** is open and leads to a new area (likely outside, as it’s the only open door from the kitchen). The compost is not yet visible, but exiting through **door_16** is the next logical step to locate it.

- **door_16** is open and accessible; no obstacles block the path.  
- Compost is likely beyond **door_16** (since it’s the only exit from the kitchen).

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
The agent returned to the kitchen after previously exploring the storage_room via door_16. The onion remains in inventory, and the compost has not been located.  

**Facts:**  
- Onion is in inventory.  
- Agent is in the kitchen.  
- Door_14 (to kitchen) is open.  
- Door_16 (to storage_room) is open.  
- Door_17 (to exterior) is closed and too far to interact.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Compost may be in the storage_room or beyond door_16.  
- Door_16 might lead to the exterior (if storage_room is a transitional area).  
- Compost could be in the kitchen (though previously unlocated).  

**Proved/Disproved Assumptions:**  
- **Proved:** Door_16 leads to storage_room (confirmed via prior traversal).  
- **Disproved:** Compost is not in the kitchen (no prior detection).  
- **Uncertain:** Whether door_16 connects directly to the exterior (requires further exploration).  

**Next Step:** Proceed through door_16 to storage_room again to confirm compost location or check for alternative exits.

- Onion_3 was successfully dropped into the compost at (0,4.5) in the hallway.  
- Inventory is now empty.  
- Door_17 remains open and directly connects to the compost.  

**Facts:**  
- Onion is in **hallway compost** (0,4.5).  
- **Door_17 is open** and leads to the compost.  
- Inventory is **empty** (onion dropped).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Door_17 leads directly to the compost (proven correct).  
- Compost is accessible via Door_17 (proven correct).  

**Proved/Disproved Assumptions:**
