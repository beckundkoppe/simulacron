Goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [162] Place the carrot from your inventory on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No.  
The goal “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” requires two sub‑steps:  
1. **Move to the table** (you must be at the table’s location).  
2. **Place the carrot** (drop the carrot onto the table).  

Since the plan tree only lists the final action, it is not yet fully decomposed. You need to add the movement step before you can place the carrot.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to (1,4)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

| Item | Location / State |
|------|------------------|
| Human | (1, 4) |
| Table | (1, 4), empty |
| Carrot | still in human’s inventory |
| Chair | unchanged (not used) |

**Assumptions that were made**

1. **Moving to the table would bring the human to the table’s surface.**  
   *Result:* Correct – the human is now at the table’s coordinates.

2. **Using a chair to climb onto the table was necessary.**  
   *Result:* Wrong – the human moved directly to the table without using the chair.

3. **The carrot would automatically be placed on the table when the human moved there.**  
   *Result:* Wrong – the carrot remains in the inventory; no “place” action was performed.

**Summary**

The action sequence achieved the sub‑goal of positioning the human at the table but failed to place the carrot on the table. The assumption that the chair was required was unnecessary, and the assumption that moving to the table would place the carrot was incorrect. The next minimal action would be to **take the carrot from inventory and put it on the table**.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The goal “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” can be achieved with a single atomic action: **place carrot on table**. The human is already at the table, the table is empty, and the carrot is in the inventory, so no further sub‑steps are required. The plan tree is fully decomposed and ready for execution.

[user] Goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [165] Place the carrot from your inventory on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Reasoning: Yes. The goal “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” can be achieved with a single atomic action: **place carrot on table**. The human is already at the table, the table is empty, and the carrot is in the inventory, so no further sub‑steps are required. The plan tree is fully decomposed and ready for execution.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries. The facts remain:

- Human is at (1, 4) on the table.  
- Table is empty.  
- Carrot is in the human’s inventory.

[user] 
Plan:
Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[user] Plan:
Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Use add_trial(text) for each distinct idea to try. Keep them concise and actionable.Respond only with add_trial() tool calls, one per idea. If there is no new idea call noop().

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Put the carrot on the table.

            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
