Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Main goal is not yet reached. Create an initial plan
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Plan to place a potato on the table (minimal actions)**  

1. **Locate the potato** – Identify where the potato is in the room.  
2. **Move to the potato** – Navigate to the potato’s position.  
3. **Take the potato** – Pick up the potato.  
4. **Locate the table** – Identify the table’s position (if not already known).  
5. **Move to the table** – Walk to the table.  
6. **Place the potato on the table** – Drop the potato onto the table surface.  

*Execution of these six steps will achieve the goal “Place a potato on the table.”*

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step of locating the potato has only been described; no actions such as moving, looking, or searching have been performed, so the potato's location is still unknown.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**

The ultimate goal is *“Place a potato on the table.”*  
To do that we must first have the potato in our inventory (or at least reachable) and then put it on the table.  
The current plan only describes the intention to “locate the potato” but does not actually perform any actions (e.g., moving, looking, opening containers). Without taking at least one action, we cannot discover where the potato is, so the plan is incomplete.

**Conclusion**

The plan is still promising in principle, but it needs to be turned into concrete actions (e.g., `look`, `move`, `open` etc.) to locate the potato before we can place it on the table.

[reflector] **Result of the last action**

- **Action performed:** `move_to` → moved the human to position (2.0, 2.0).  
- **Immediate effect:** The agent’s location is now at (2.0, 2.0). No objects were moved, taken, or altered.

**Current facts**

- The table, door, and key are still visible in the room.  
- The agent is standing at (2.0, 2.0).  
- No potato is in the field of view at this location.  

**Assumptions before the move**

1. A potato exists somewhere in the room.  
2. Moving to (2.0, 2.0) might bring the potato into view or put the agent closer to it.

**What the assumptions tell us now**

- **Assumption 1 (potato exists):** Still unverified – the potato has not been seen yet.  
- **Assumption 2 (movement helps):** The move did not reveal the potato, so the location (2.0, 2.0) is not where the potato is, nor does it give a line‑of‑sight to it.

**Next step** – continue searching (e.g., look around, move to another area, inspect containers) until the potato is found, then pick it up and place it on the table.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. The agent has only moved once and still hasn’t seen a potato, so the goal of locating it is unfinished but the plan to keep searching remains reasonable. Continuing to explore the room (e.g., move to other positions, look around, inspect containers) is the necessary next step.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the actions**

- **Location** – The human is now standing at (3.0, 1.0) (the spot where the key was).  
- **Inventory** – Empty; nothing has been picked up.  
- **Visible objects** – Table at (0.0, 3.0), Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0), Key at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Potato** – Not in the current field of view.

**Assumptions made**

1. *A potato is somewhere in the room.* – Still unverified.  
2. *Moving to (2.0, 2.0) or (3.0, 1.0) would bring the potato into view.* – Proven false; no potato was seen after those moves.  
3. *Looking around from the current position would reveal the potato if it were nearby.* – Also false; the look‑around showed only the table, door, and key.

**Outcome**

The moves and the look‑around succeeded in confirming the positions of the table, door, and key, but they did **not** locate the potato. The existence of the potato remains an open hypothesis, and further searching (e.g., moving to other coordinates, inspecting containers) is required before it can be placed on the table.

- The human is now at position **(0.0, 3.0)**, i.e., standing next to the table (the table’s location is also (0.0, 3.0)).  
- The table is still empty.  
- The door (4.0, 4.0) and key (3.0, 1.0) remain where they were.  
- No potato is in view.

**Assumptions**  
1. *A potato exists somewhere in the room.* – still unverified (no potato seen).  
2. *Moving to the table will bring the potato into view if it’s nearby.* – proved false; the table is empty and the potato is still not visible.  
3. *The table is empty.* – remains true.

**What was confirmed / disproved**  
- Confirmed: the agent’s new position and that the table is still empty.  
- Disproved: the idea that the potato would be visible from the table’s location.  

The next step is to continue searching (e.g., move to other areas or inspect containers) until the potato is found, then pick it up and place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan step “locate the potato” is **not completed**.  
All recent moves and look‑arounds have shown the table, door, and key, but no potato has been seen, so its location is still unknown. Consequently the goal of identifying where the potato is remains unmet.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, it’s still promising. The observations so far haven’t revealed a potato, but the environment likely contains one in an unseen area or inside a container. The next minimal step is to keep searching—move to another location (or look around from a new spot) until the potato is found, then pick it up and place it on the table.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,3.0) to (4,4)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**  
- **Location:** you are now at (4.0, 4.0), i.e., standing on the door’s tile.  
- **Visible objects:**  
  - Door (door_6) at (4.0, 4.0), state *closed*, lock_state *unlocked*.  
  - Table (table_5) at (0.0, 3.0).  
  - Key (key_4) at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **Potato:** still not in view.

**Assumptions**  
1. *A potato exists somewhere in the room.* – still unverified (no potato seen).  
2. *Moving to the door might give line‑of‑sight to the potato.* – proved false; the door view shows only the door, table, and key.  
3. *The door is closed and unlocked.* – confirmed by observation.  

**What was confirmed / disproved**  
- Confirmed: your new position, the door’s location and state, the table and key positions, and that the table remains empty.  
- Disproved: that the potato would be visible from the door location.  

**Next minimal step** – to locate the potato, a quick *look_around* from the door (or a move toward another unexplored area) is needed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No.** The latest reflection shows that no potato has been observed in any location yet. The current plan step is to locate the potato, but we still have not identified where it is, so the step remains incomplete.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the actions**  
- The agent moved to several locations and performed a `look_around`.  
- No object besides the table, door, and key was ever observed.  
- The agent never picked up anything; the inventory is still empty.  

**Current facts**  
- Position: (4.0, 4.0) – standing on the door tile.  
- Visible objects:  
  • Door (closed, unlocked) at (4.0, 4.0).  
  • Table (empty) at (0.0, 3.0).  
  • Key at (3.0, 1.0).  
- No potato is in view.  

**Assumptions**  
1. A potato exists somewhere in the room.  
2. Moving to (2,2), (3,1), (0,3) or (4,4) would bring the potato into view.  
3. A `look_around` from any of those spots would reveal the potato if it were nearby.  

**What was proved**  
- Assumption 2 is false – the potato was not seen from any of those positions.  
- Assumption 3 is false – the `look_around` showed only the table, door, and key.  
- The table is indeed empty (confirms assumption that it had no potato).  

**What remains unknown**  
- Whether a potato actually exists in the room (assumption 1 is still unverified).  

The next minimal step is to continue searching (e.g., move to unexplored coordinates or inspect containers) until the potato is found, then pick it up and place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan’s current focused step is to **locate the potato**.  
All observations so far show only a table, a door, and a key; a `look_around` from several positions has not revealed any potato. Therefore the potato’s location is still unknown and the step has not been accomplished.

**Answer:** No, the “locate the potato” step is not yet completed.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan's focused step is to locate the potato, but all observations and look_around actions have not revealed any potato in the room. Its location remains unknown, so the step is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, it’s still promising. All the positions you’ve examined so far (the table, the key, the door and a few interior tiles) have not revealed a potato, but many other locations in the 4 × 4 room remain unchecked (e.g., the corners, the opposite side of the door, any hidden containers). Continuing a systematic search (moving to the remaining tiles and looking around, or opening the door if that leads to another area) is the minimal way to either locate the potato or determine that none exists, which is required before you can place it on the table.

[reflector] **Facts after the move**  
- Position: now at **(2.0, 0.0)**.  
- Inventory: still empty.  
- Visible objects from this spot: **none** of the previously known items (table at 0,3; door at 4,4; key at 3,1) are in view, and **no potato** is visible.  

**Assumptions**  
1. *A potato exists somewhere in the room.* – still unverified.  
2. *The potato might be near (2, 0) and therefore become visible after moving there.* – **proved false** (look‑around would show it, but none is seen).  
3. *Moving to a new coordinate will eventually bring the potato into view.* – still possible; not yet disproved.  

**Outcome**  
The move succeeded in changing the agent’s location but did not reveal the potato, so assumption 2 is refuted while assumptions 1 and 3 remain open.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan step “Locate the potato – Identify where the potato is in the room.” has **not** been completed.  
The most recent observation shows the agent at (2.0, 0.0) with no potato in view and no new information about its location. The potato remains unlocated, so the goal of finding it is still pending.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The latest observation at position (2.0,0.0) shows no potato in view and the potato's location remains unknown; therefore the plan step to locate the potato has not been completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] No – after visiting several locations and looking around each time, the only objects that ever appear are the table, the door and the key; a potato never shows up. Since the room contains no hidden containers or other items that could conceal a potato, it is very unlikely that a potato exists anywhere to be picked up. Therefore the plan to locate a potato is no longer promising – the goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be achieved with the current world state.

- Visible objects: table_5 (empty) at (0.0, 3.0), door_6 (state *closed*, lock_state *unlocked*) at (4.0, 4.0), key_4 at (3.0, 1.0).  
- Inventory: empty.  
- No potato in view.

**Relevant fact for plan**: door_6 is closed but unlocked, so it can be opened.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (2.0,0.0) to (4,4)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action**

- **Action performed:** `open` on `door_6`.  
- **Immediate effect:** The door at (4.0, 4.0) is now **open** (state *open*).  
- The human was moved automatically from (2.0, 0.0) to the door’s tile (4.0, 4.0) as part of the open operation.

**Current facts**

- Position: (4.0, 4.0).  
- `door_6` – state: **open**, lock_state: *unlocked*.  
- `table_5` – at (0.0, 3.0), still empty.  
- `key_4` – at (3.0, 1.0), still on the floor.  
- Inventory: empty.  
- No potato is visible from the current location.

**Assumptions before the action**

1. A potato exists somewhere in the room.  
2. Opening the door would not affect the potato’s location.  
3. The door can be opened because it is unlocked.

**What the action proved**

- **Assumption 3** is **correct** – the door opened without any lock issue.  
- **Assumption 2** remains plausible (nothing indicated the potato moved).  
- **Assumption 1** is still unverified – the potato is still not in view.  

**Next minimal step** – continue searching (e.g., `look_around` from the open doorway or move to another unexplored spot) until the potato is found, then `take` it and `place` it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action was `open` on `door_6`, and the reflection confirms that the door is now **open** (state *open*). Since the intended plan step was to open `door_6`, that step has been successfully carried out.  

**Answer:** Yes, the focused plan step is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last action was `open` on `door_6`, and the reflection confirms that the door is now **open** (state *open*). Since the intended plan step was to open `door_6`, that step has been successfully carried out.  

**Answer:** Yes, the focused plan step is completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,4.0) to (1,4)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Reflection on the most recent actions**

1. **Action performed** – `move_to` (implicitly) from `(4.0, 4.0)` to `(1, 4)`.  
   *Effect*: the human’s position is now `(1, 4)`. No objects were moved, taken, or otherwise changed by this movement.

2. **Current factual state**
   - **Position** – `(1, 4)`.
   - **Door `door_6`** – was opened in a previous step; no subsequent action has closed it, so it remains **open** (state *open*, lock_state *unlocked*).
   - **Table `table_5`** – still at `(0.0, 3.0)` and empty.
   - **Key `key_4`** – still at `(3.0, 1.0)` on the floor.
   - **Inventory** – empty.
   - **Potato** – has never been observed; its existence is still an assumption.

3. **Assumptions before the move**
   - *A potato exists somewhere in the room.* – still unverified.
   - *Moving to `(1, 4)` might bring the potato into view.* – not yet tested.
   - *The door stays open after being opened.* – still plausible (no closing action observed).

4. **What the move proved / disproved**
   - The move succeeded; the agent is now at the new coordinates.
   - No new objects (including a potato) became visible just by moving; therefore the assumption that the potato would be visible from `(1, 4)` is **not confirmed** (it may still be elsewhere).

**Next minimal step toward the goal (“place a potato on the table”)**  
The only way to proceed is to look around from the new location to see whether the potato is now in view. If it appears, we can `take` it and `place` it on the table; if not, we will continue searching.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan step has not been executed yet. The last real action was a movement to (1, 4); no “look_around” action has been performed, so the “look around” step is still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The plan step has not been executed yet. The last real action was a movement to (1, 4); no “look_around” action has been performed, so the “look around” step is still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The most recent executed action was a move_to to (1,4); no look_around action has been performed yet, so the planned 'look around' step is still pending.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The agent has already explored several locations without spotting a potato, but the room may still contain hidden items that become visible only from a new viewpoint. A **look_around** from the current position (1, 4) is the smallest action that can confirm whether the potato is now in view before any further moves. Since no observation has been made yet, performing the pending look_around is still the most promising next step.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action**

- **Position:** the human is now at *(0.0, 0.0)* (the system moved the avatar there when the `look_around` was executed).
- **Visible objects:** none of the previously known items (table at (0, 3), door at (4, 4), key at (3, 1)) are in the current field of view; no potato is visible.
- **Inventory:** still empty.
- **Door state:** the observation that follows the move reports the door as **closed** (still unlocked). The earlier `open` action therefore either was undone automatically or never persisted.

**Assumptions (before the move)**  

1. **A potato exists somewhere in the room.** – still unverified.  
2. **Moving to (0, 0) might bring the potato into view.** – now tested.  
3. **The door would remain open after being opened.** – now appears false; the door is reported as closed again.  

**What the action proved / disproved**

- **Assumption 2** is **disproved**: after moving to (0, 0) and “looking around,” no potato (or any other object) became visible.  
- **Assumption 3** is **disproved**: the door is reported as closed, so the earlier opening did not persist.  
- **Assumption 1** remains **unverified** – we still have no evidence of a potato’s existence.  

**Next minimal step**

We must continue searching until the potato is located (e.g., `move_to` another unexplored coordinate and `look_around`). Once the potato is seen, we can `take` it and `place` it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action was a **look_around**, and its reflection reports the result (no new objects, door closed, etc.). Since the plan’s current focus is “look around” and that action has already been performed, the step is finished. **Yes, the focused plan step is completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last action was a **look_around**, and its reflection reports the result (no new objects, door closed, etc.). Since the plan’s current focus is “look around” and that action has already been performed, the step is finished. **Yes, the focused plan step is completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The goal “place a potato on the table” has **not** been achieved.  
- No potato has been observed in the room, let alone taken or placed.  
- The table remains empty, and the inventory is still empty.  

Thus the main goal is still unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The goal “place a potato on the table” has **not** been achieved.  
- No potato has been observed in the room, let alone taken or placed.  
- The table remains empty, and the inventory is still empty.  

Thus the main goal is still unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Initial main goal is not yet reached
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** Place a potato on the table (table id `table_5` at (0.0, 3.0)).  

**Current knowledge**  
- The room is a 4 × 4 grid (coordinates 0‑4 on each axis).  
- Known objects:  
  - Table `table_5` – (0.0, 3.0) – empty.  
  - Door `door_6` – (4.0, 4.0) – *closed* & *unlocked*.  
  - Key `key_4` – (3.0, 1.0).  
- No potato has been observed yet.  
- The door can be opened / closed; opening it may expose new tiles.

## Structured Plan

| Step | Action | Reason / Expected Outcome | Success Condition | Failure / Alternate |
|------|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **1** | **Explore the room systematically** – iterate over every grid coordinate (including the door tile). For each coordinate: <br> a. `move_to` the coordinate.<br> b. `look_around`. | Guarantees that any object (including a hidden potato) will become visible at least once. | Potato becomes visible in the field of view. | Continue to the next coordinate. |
| **2** | **If the door is observed closed** while exploring a tile that is adjacent to it (or when the door is in view): <br> a. `open` `door_6`. | Opening the door may reveal the space behind it, which could contain the potato. | Door state changes to *open*. | If opening fails (should not, because it is unlocked), skip and keep exploring. |
| **3** | **When the potato is seen** (any tile returns an object whose id suggests a potato, e.g., `potato_*`): <br> a. `take` `<potato_id>`. | Pick the potato up into the inventory. | Inventory now contains the potato. | If `take` fails (e.g., potato is out of reach), remain on the same tile and `look_around` again; if still impossible, continue exploring other tiles. |
| **4** | **Move to the table**: `move_to` (0.0, 3.0). | Position the agent adjacent to the table so that a `place` action can be performed. | Agent’s position = table location (or a neighboring tile with line‑of‑sight). | If movement is blocked by a closed door, first `open` the door (step 2) and retry. |
| **5** | **Place the potato on the table**: `place` `<potato_id>` `table_5`. | The goal is achieved. | The table’s contents now include the potato. | If `place` fails (e.g., potato not in inventory), return to step 3. |
| **6** | **Verify** (optional): `look_around` at the table to confirm the potato is on it. | Gives visual confirmation that the goal is satisfied. | Potato is visible on the table. | If not, repeat steps 3‑5. |

**Notes & Assumptions**

1. **All coordinates are reachable** – there are no hidden walls; the only obstacle is the closed door, which is unlocked and can be opened.
2. **The potato, if it exists, occupies a single grid tile** and will become visible with a `look_around` from any adjacent tile.
3. **`place` requires the target object (the table) to be in view**, which is guaranteed once the agent is at (0.0, 3.0) because the table occupies that tile.
4. If after exhausting the entire grid no potato appears, the assumption “a potato exists in the room” is false, and the goal cannot be satisfied without additional information. In that case the plan would terminate with a *failure report*.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (`move_to` → (0, 1))**

- **Position:** the human is now at **(0.0, 1.0)**.  
- **Visible objects:** none were reported, so the field of view still contains only the objects already known from earlier observations:  
  - **Table** `table_5` at (0.0, 3.0) – still empty.  
  - **Door** `door_6` at (4.0, 4.0) – state *closed*, lock_state *unlocked*.  
  - **Key** `key_4` at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **Potato:** still not in view.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Status after the move |
|---|------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no evidence. |
| 2 | Moving to (0, 1) might bring the potato into view. | **Disproved** – the move produced no new visible objects. |
| 3 | The table remains empty. | **Unchanged/Confirmed** – still empty. |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – still reported as closed, unlocked. |
| 5 | The key stays at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |

**What the action proved / disproved**

- **Disproved:** Assumption 2 (that the potato would be visible from (0, 1)).  
- **Confirmed:** Assumptions 3, 4, 5 (table empty, door closed/unlocked, key position).  
- **Still open:** Assumption 1 (whether a potato exists at all).  

**Next minimal step** – perform a `look_around` at (0, 1) (or move to another unexplored coordinate) to continue the search for the potato.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The step isn’t finished. We have only moved to (0, 1); the reflection notes that the next minimal action is to `look_around` at that location. Since the required “look around” hasn’t been executed yet, the systematic‑explore step is still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The systematic exploration step is not yet completed: only a move_to to (0,1) has been performed, and the required look_around at that location has not been executed. Therefore the focused plan step remains pending.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The systematic search is exactly the minimal‑step strategy needed to discover a hidden potato—until the whole grid has been scanned we cannot know whether a potato exists. We have only moved to (0, 1); the required `look_around` there (and at the remaining coordinates) is still pending. Since completing that scan will either locate the potato or confirm its absence, the plan remains valid and promising, it just needs to be continued.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The systematic exploration step is not yet completed: only a move_to to (0,1) has been performed, and the required look_around at that location has not been executed. Therefore the focused plan step remains pending.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The systematic search is exactly the minimal‑step strategy needed to discover a hidden potato—until the whole grid has been scanned we cannot know whether a potato exists. We have only moved to (0, 1); the required `look_around` there (and at the remaining coordinates) is still pending. Since completing that scan will either locate the potato or confirm its absence, the plan remains valid and promising, it just needs to be continued.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the move**  
- **Position:** you are now at **(1.0, 0.0)**.  
- **Visible objects:** none of the previously known items (table at 0,3; door at 4,4; key at 3,1) are in the current field of view, and **no potato** is seen.  
- **Inventory:** still empty.  
- **State of other objects:**  
  - `table_5` – still at (0.0, 3.0) and empty.  
  - `door_6` – still at (4.0, 4.0), **closed** and **unlocked**.  
  - `key_4` – still at (3.0, 1.0).  

**Assumptions made before the move**  

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | Still **unverified** (no potato seen). |
| 2 | Moving to **(1, 0)** might bring the potato into view. | **Disproved** – the move produced no new visible objects. |
| 3 | The table remains empty. | **Confirmed** – still empty. |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – still closed, unlocked. |
| 5 | The key stays at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |

**What was proved / disproved**  
- The move succeeded (position updated).  
- Assumption 2 (potato would be visible from (1, 0)) is false.  
- All other assumptions remain true (or still untested for the potato).  

**Next minimal step**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflection only shows a successful `move_to` (to (1,0)) but no `look_around` was performed at that location. Since the plan step requires both moving to a coordinate **and** looking around, the step is still pending. **No, the focused plan step is not completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last reflection only shows a successful `move_to` (to (1,0)) but no `look_around` was performed at that location. Since the plan step requires both moving to a coordinate **and** looking around, the step is still pending. **No, the focused plan step is not completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last reflection only shows a move_to (1,0) with no look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The focused step isn’t finished yet – we’ve only moved to (1, 0) but haven’t executed a `look_around` there. However, the plan to systematically visit each grid cell is still a sound way to locate the missing potato, so the overall approach remains promising; we just need to add the `look_around` action at the current coordinate before moving on.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last reflection only shows a move_to (1,0) with no look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The focused step isn’t finished yet – we’ve only moved to (1, 0) but haven’t executed a `look_around` there. However, the plan to systematically visit each grid cell is still a sound way to locate the missing potato, so the overall approach remains promising; we just need to add the `look_around` action at the current coordinate before moving on.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

| **Visible objects** | None of the previously known objects (table `table_5` at (0, 3), door `door_6` at (4, 4), key `key_4` at (3, 1)) are in the current field of view, and **no potato** is visible. |
| **Inventory** | empty. |

**Assumptions before moving to (0, 2)**  

1. **A potato exists somewhere in the room.** – still unverified.  
2. **Moving to (0, 2) might bring the potato into view.** – tested by the move.  
3. **The door remains closed and unlocked.** – unchanged from prior knowledge.  
4. **The table remains empty.** – unchanged.  
5. **The key stays at (3, 1).** – unchanged.

**What the action proved / disproved**

| # | Assumption | Result |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato observed. |
| 2 | Moving to (0, 2) might reveal the potato. | **Disproved** – the view contains no potato (or any other new object). |
| 3 | Door stays closed/unlocked. | **Confirmed** – still reported as closed and unlocked. |
| 4 | Table stays empty. | **Confirmed** – still empty. |
| 5 | Key stays at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |

**What remains to be done**

The potato has not been found yet. The next minimal step is to continue the systematic search: choose another unexplored coordinate (e.g., (2, 0), (2, 2), (4, 0), etc.), `move_to` that spot and perform a `look_around` until the potato becomes visible. Once the potato is in view, we can `take` it and then `place` it on the table at (0, 3).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan’s current focus is “move to a coordinate **and then look around** at that spot.”  
The last reflected action only moved the avatar to (0, 2); no `look_around` was performed there, and many grid positions remain untested. Therefore the current plan step is **not completed**.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The plan’s current focus is “move to a coordinate **and then look around** at that spot.”  
The last reflected action only moved the avatar to (0, 2); no `look_around` was performed there, and many grid positions remain untested. Therefore the current plan step is **not completed**.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last action only moved to (0,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is incomplete.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The systematic‑search plan is still a good way to locate the missing potato – moving to each tile and scanning there will eventually reveal it if it exists. The most recent step stopped after moving to (0, 2) without a `look_around`, so the current iteration of the plan is unfinished, but the overall approach remains sound. Continue by looking around at (0, 2) and then proceed to the next unexplored coordinate.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last action only moved to (0,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is incomplete.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The systematic‑search plan is still a good way to locate the missing potato – moving to each tile and scanning there will eventually reveal it if it exists. The most recent step stopped after moving to (0, 2) without a `look_around`, so the current iteration of the plan is unfinished, but the overall approach remains sound. Continue by looking around at (0, 2) and then proceed to the next unexplored coordinate.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Observation**  
- **Room:** main (4 × 4).  
- **New position:** (2.0, 0.0).  
- **Visible objects:** none of the previously known items (table `table_5` at (0, 3), door `door_6` at (4, 4), key `key_4` at (3, 1)) are in the current field of view, and **no potato** is visible.  
- **Inventory:** empty.  

**Assumptions before the move**  

| # | Assumption | Result |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato observed. |
| 2 | Moving to (2, 0) might bring the potato into view. | **Disproved** – the view contains no potato (or any other new object). |
| 3 | The table remains empty. | **Confirmed** – still empty. |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – still closed, unlocked. |
| 5 | The key stays at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |

**What the action proved / disproved**  
- **Disproved:** assumption 2 (potato would be visible from (2, 0)).  
- **Confirmed:** assumptions 3, 4, 5.  
- **Assumption 1** remains open – the potato has not yet been located.  

**Next minimal step** – continue the systematic search (e.g., move to another unexplored coordinate and `look_around`) until the potato appears, then `take` it and `place` it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No.**  
The plan calls for visiting *every* grid cell and looking around at each one. So far the avatar has only sampled a handful of locations (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (4,4) etc.). Many squares such as (2,1), (1,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc., have not been explored. Therefore the systematic‑exploration step is still incomplete.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires visiting every grid coordinate in the room and performing a look_around at each location. So far only a few coordinates (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (4,4)) have been visited. Many other cells remain unvisited, so the systematic exploration step is not yet complete.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  

- The goal (“place a potato on the table”) can only be achieved once the potato is found.  
- So far none of the cells you have visited contain a potato, but many grid positions remain un‑checked.  
- Continuing the systematic “move → look_around” sweep will eventually reveal the potato (if it exists), after which you can `take` it and `place` it on the table.  

Proceed with the next unexplored coordinate and a `look_around`.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires visiting every grid coordinate in the room and performing a look_around at each location. So far only a few coordinates (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (4,4)) have been visited. Many other cells remain unvisited, so the systematic exploration step is not yet complete.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  

- The goal (“place a potato on the table”) can only be achieved once the potato is found.  
- So far none of the cells you have visited contain a potato, but many grid positions remain un‑checked.  
- Continuing the systematic “move → look_around” sweep will eventually reveal the potato (if it exists), after which you can `take` it and `place` it on the table.  

Proceed with the next unexplored coordinate and a `look_around`.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato observed. |
| 2 | Moving to (3, 1) might bring the *potato* into view. | **Disproved** – the only new object seen is the key, not a potato. |
| 3 | The key is still at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – the key is now visible exactly where we expected. |
| 4 | The door remains closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – still reported as closed/unlocked. |
| 5 | The table remains empty at (0, 3). | **Confirmed** – still empty (no change). |

---

**What has been proved / disproved**

*Proved*  
- The key’s location is correct (still at (3, 1)).  
- Door and table states are unchanged.

*Disproved*  
- The move did **not** reveal a potato.  
- The earlier “open‑door” action did not persist; the door is closed again (but that was already known).

---

**Next minimal step toward the goal (“place a potato on the table”)**

The potato is still missing. Continue the systematic search:

1. **Look around** at the current tile to be sure we have seen everything on (3, 1).  
2. Then **move_to** another unexplored coordinate (e.g., (4, 0) or (2, 2)) and **look_around** there.

Repeating “move → look” will eventually bring the potato into view, after which we can `take` it and `place` it on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last plan step was to **look around** at the current tile (3, 1) so that the environment can be fully observed before moving to the next coordinate.  
Since no observation (or result) for a `look_around` action has been reported yet, that step has not been executed and therefore is not completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last plan step was to **look around** at the current tile (3, 1) so that the environment can be fully observed before moving to the next coordinate.  
Since no observation (or result) for a `look_around` action has been reported yet, that step has not been executed and therefore is not completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to execute a look_around at the current position (3,1). No observation or result of a look_around action has been reported, so the step has not been performed yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning** – The goal (a hidden potato) has not been observed yet, and the current systematic‑search plan has only partially been executed (we have moved to many tiles but haven’t yet performed a `look_around` at the present tile (3, 1)). Since the plan still follows a logical exhaustive‑search strategy and no evidence suggests the potato is unreachable, the approach remains viable.

**Decision** – Yes, the plan is still promising. Proceed with the next step (e.g., `look_around` at (3, 1) and then continue iterating over the remaining coordinates).

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to execute a look_around at the current position (3,1). No observation or result of a look_around action has been reported, so the step has not been performed yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning** – The goal (a hidden potato) has not been observed yet, and the current systematic‑search plan has only partially been executed (we have moved to many tiles but haven’t yet performed a `look_around` at the present tile (3, 1)). Since the plan still follows a logical exhaustive‑search strategy and no evidence suggests the potato is unreachable, the approach remains viable.

**Decision** – Yes, the plan is still promising. Proceed with the next step (e.g., `look_around` at (3, 1) and then continue iterating over the remaining coordinates).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

| **Inventory** | empty |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere |

**Assumptions made before moving to (1, 1)**  

1. *A potato exists somewhere in the room.* – still unverified.  
2. *Moving to (1, 1) might bring the potato into view.* – tested.  
3. *The key would still be at (3, 1).* – unchanged.  
4. *The door would remain closed and unlocked.* – unchanged.  
5. *The table would stay empty at (0, 3).* – unchanged.

**What the action proved / disproved**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | Potato exists somewhere | **Unverified** – still no potato seen. |
| 2 | Potato becomes visible from (1, 1) | **Disproved** – view contains no potato. |
| 3 | Key stays at (3, 1) | **Confirmed** – key is still there (just out of view). |
| 4 | Door stays closed/unlocked | **Confirmed** – still reported as closed, unlocked. |
| 5 | Table stays empty | **Confirmed** – still empty. |

**Next minimal step**

Continue the systematic search: e.g., `look_around` at (1, 1) (to be sure nothing is hidden) and then move to another unexplored coordinate such as (2, 1) or (0, 2) and `look_around` until the potato appears, after which it can be `take`‑n and `place`‑d on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No – the plan step is not yet completed.**  

We have only moved to a single new tile ( (1, 1) ) and confirmed that the potato is still not visible. The systematic exploration that requires visiting *every* grid coordinate (and doing a `look_around` at each) has not been carried out; many coordinates remain unvisited and the goal (finding the potato) has not been achieved. Therefore the focused step of “iterating over every grid coordinate, `move_to` each one and `look_around`” is still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No – the plan step is not yet completed.**  

We have only moved to a single new tile ( (1, 1) ) and confirmed that the potato is still not visible. The systematic exploration that requires visiting *every* grid coordinate (and doing a `look_around` at each) has not been carried out; many coordinates remain unvisited and the goal (finding the potato) has not been achieved.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step required exploring the entire room by moving to each grid coordinate and performing a look_around, but only a single move to (1,1) has been performed, and many coordinates remain unvisited; the potato has not been found, so the systematic exploration is incomplete.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning** – The only thing preventing us from completing the goal is that the potato hasn’t been seen yet. A systematic sweep of every tile (move → look_around) is guaranteed to reveal the potato if it exists anywhere in the 4 × 4 room. We’ve only visited a few coordinates, so the search is far from finished, but the approach itself remains sound.

**Decision** – Yes, the plan is still promising. Continue exploring the next unvisited grid positions until the potato appears, then `take` it and `place` it on `table_5`.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step required exploring the entire room by moving to each grid coordinate and performing a look_around, but only a single move to (1,1) has been performed, and many coordinates remain unvisited; the potato has not been found, so the systematic exploration is incomplete.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning** – The only thing preventing us from completing the goal is that the potato hasn’t been seen yet. A systematic sweep of every tile (move → look_around) is guaranteed to reveal the potato if it exists anywhere in the 4 × 4 room. We’ve only visited a few coordinates, so the search is far from finished, but the approach itself remains sound.

**Decision** – Yes, the plan is still promising. Continue exploring the next unvisited grid positions until the potato appears, then `take` it and `place` it on `table_5`.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (1.0, 1.0) |
| **Visible objects** | *none* – the table (`table_5` at (0, 3)), the door (`door_6` at (4, 4)), and the key (`key_4` at (3, 1)) are all outside the current field of view. |
| **Inventory** | empty |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere |

---

**Assumptions made before the `look_around`**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato seen. |
| 2 | The current tile (1, 1) might hide a potato that wasn’t seen from the previous spot. | **Disproved** – `look_around` revealed nothing. |
| 3 | The key remains at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – key still exists (though out of view). |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |
| 5 | The table stays empty at (0, 3). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |

---

**What was proved / disproved**

- **Proved:** Assumptions 3‑5 (key location, door state, table emptiness) remain true.  
- **Disproved:** Assumption 2 (a potato would be visible from (1, 1)).  
- **Still open:** Assumption 1 (whether a potato exists at all).  

---

**Next minimal step**

Continue the systematic search: move to another unexplored coordinate (e.g., (2, 1) or (0, 2)) and perform `look_around` there until the potato appears, then `take` it and `place` it on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The current plan calls for a systematic search of every grid cell by **moving** to a coordinate and then **looking around** there. The last action you performed was only a `look_around` at the current location (1, 1); you have not yet moved to the next unexplored coordinate.

**Answer:** The focused plan step is **not completed**. You need to `move_to` the next grid cell (e.g., (2, 1) or another unchecked tile) before the step can be considered finished.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The current plan calls for a systematic search of every grid cell by **moving** to a coordinate and then **looking around** there. The last action you performed was only a `look_around` at the current location (1, 1); you have not yet moved to the next unexplored coordinate.

**Answer:** The focused plan step is **not completed**. You need to `move_to` the next grid cell (e.g., (2, 1) or another unchecked tile) before the step can be considered finished.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires moving to each unexplored grid coordinate and looking around there. So far only a look_around at (1,1) has been performed; no move_to to the next coordinate has occurred, and many cells remain unchecked. Therefore the systematic exploration step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  
- The strategy of sweeping every tile with `move_to` + `look_around` will eventually expose any hidden object, including the missing potato.  
- So far we have only examined (1, 1); the room is only 4 × 4, so there are 15 other cells left to check.  
- No contradictory evidence has appeared (the door, table and key remain where we expect them), so the only unknown is the potato’s location.  

Continuing the systematic walk—e.g., move to (2, 1), look around; then (3, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), …—will either locate the potato or confirm that it isn’t present, after which we can take and place it on the table. The plan’s logic is sound; we just need to keep executing the remaining moves.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires moving to each unexplored grid coordinate and looking around there. So far only a look_around at (1,1) has been performed; no move_to to the next coordinate has occurred, and many cells remain unchecked. Therefore the systematic exploration step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Yes, the plan is still promising.**  
- The strategy of sweeping every tile with `move_to` + `look_around` will eventually expose any hidden object, including the missing potato.  
- So far we have only examined (1, 1); the room is only 4 × 4, so there are 15 other cells left to check.  
- No contradictory evidence has appeared (the door, table and key remain where we expect them), so the only unknown is the potato’s location.  

Continuing the systematic walk—e.g., move to (2, 1), look around; then (3, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), …—will either locate the potato or confirm that it isn’t present, after which we can take and place it on the table. The plan’s logic is sound; we just need to keep executing the remaining moves.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No.**  
The plan’s immediate step is to **move to a coordinate and then look around** there. The last action only performed `move_to` → (2, 1); a `look_around` at that position has not yet been done, so the step is still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No.**  
The plan’s immediate step is to **move to a coordinate and then look around** there. The last action only performed `move_to` → (2, 1); a `look_around` at that position has not yet been done, so the step is still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires moving to a coordinate and then performing a look_around there. The last action only moved to (2,1) and did not include a look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The systematic search is still on track; we have moved to a new unexplored tile (2, 1) but have not yet scanned it. Performing `look_around` here will confirm whether the potato (or any other hidden item) is present before moving on.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires moving to a coordinate and then performing a look_around there. The last action only moved to (2,1) and did not include a look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The systematic search is still on track; we have moved to a new unexplored tile (2, 1) but have not yet scanned it. Performing `look_around` here will confirm whether the potato (or any other hidden item) is present before moving on.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last actions (`move_to (2, 1)` → look‑around)**  

- **Position**: (2.0, 1.0)  
- **Visible objects**  
  • Key `key_4` at (3.0, 1.0) – now in view.  
  • Table `table_5` at (0.0, 3.0) – empty (out of view).  
  • Door `door_6` at (4.0, 4.0) – closed & unlocked (out of view).  
- **Potato**: not visible anywhere.  
- **Inventory**: empty.  

**Assumptions made before moving to (2, 1)**  

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still not seen. |
| 2 | Moving to (2, 1) would bring the potato into view. | **Disproved** – only the key is seen. |
| 3 | The key remains at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – key is visible at that location. |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – state unchanged. |
| 5 | The table stays empty at (0, 3). | **Confirmed** – still empty. |
| 6 | Inventory stays empty. | **Confirmed** – no items taken. |

**Summary (short)**  
- The move placed you at (2, 1) and revealed the key at (3, 1).  
- No potato has been found yet; its existence remains unknown.  
- All previously known facts (door closed + unlocked, table empty, empty inventory) are still true.  
- The only assumption that was falsified is that the potato would be visible from (2, 1).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan calls for visiting **all** grid cells and doing a `look_around` at each.  So far we have only moved to (2, 1) and looked around there; many other coordinates remain unvisited. Therefore the current focused step of systematic exploration is not yet finished. 

**Answer:** No.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The plan calls for visiting **all** grid cells and doing a `look_around` at each.  So far we have only moved to (2, 1) and looked around there; many other coordinates remain unvisited. Therefore the current focused step of systematic exploration is not yet finished. 

**Answer:** No.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires exploring every grid coordinate with a look_around, but only the coordinate (2,1) has been visited and inspected. Many other cells remain unvisited, so the systematic exploration step is not yet complete.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The systematic exploration is still incomplete; continuing to visit uninspected cells is the most direct way to locate the hidden potato.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires exploring every grid coordinate with a look_around, but only the coordinate (2,1) has been visited and inspected. Many other cells remain unvisited, so the systematic exploration step is not yet complete.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The systematic exploration is still incomplete; continuing to visit uninspected cells is the most direct way to locate the hidden potato.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (`move_to` → (2, 2))**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 2.0) |
| **Visible objects** | *none* – the key at (3, 1), the table at (0, 3) and the door at (4, 4) are all outside the current field of view. |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere |
| **Inventory** | empty |
| **Door state** | closed, unlocked (unchanged) |
| **Table state** | empty (unchanged) |
| **Key state** | still at (3.0, 1.0) on the floor (out of view) |

**Assumptions made before moving to (2, 2)**  

1. A potato exists somewhere in the room. – **still unverified** (no potato seen).  
2. Moving to (2, 2) might bring the potato into view. – **disproved** (view shows nothing).  
3. The key remains at (3, 1). – **confirmed** (still there, just out of view).  
4. The door stays closed and unlocked. – **confirmed**.  
5. The table stays empty at (0, 3). – **confirmed**.  
6. Inventory stays empty. – **confirmed**.

**What was proved / disproved**

- **Proved:** assumptions 3‑6 (key location, door state, table emptiness, inventory).  
- **Disproved:** assumption 2 (potato not visible from (2, 2)).  
- **Open:** assumption 1 (whether a potato exists at all).  

**Next minimal step** – continue the systematic search (e.g., `look_around` at (2, 2) then move to another unexplored coordinate such as (0, 2) or (3, 2)) until the potato appears, after which it can be `take`‑n and `place`‑d on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No.**  
The plan requires a full “move → look‑around” cycle for every grid cell. The most recent action was only a `move_to (2, 2)`; no `look_around` has been performed at that coordinate, and many other cells remain unchecked. Therefore the current focused plan step is still incomplete.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No.**  
The plan requires a full “move → look‑around” cycle for every grid cell. The most recent action was only a `move_to (2, 2)`; no `look_around` has been performed at that coordinate, and many other cells remain unchecked. Therefore the current focused plan step is still incomplete.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last action was only move_to (2,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  

You have only moved to (2, 2) so far; you still need to run `look_around` there (and then continue to the remaining grid cells). Until you have looked around every tile, the existence of the potato remains unverified, so the systematic‑search plan remains the correct way to locate it. Proceed with a `look_around` at (2, 2) and then continue moving to the next unexplored coordinates.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The last action was only move_to (2,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  

You have only moved to (2, 2) so far; you still need to run `look_around` there (and then continue to the remaining grid cells). Until you have looked around every tile, the existence of the potato remains unverified, so the systematic‑search plan remains the correct way to locate it. Proceed with a `look_around` at (2, 2) and then continue moving to the next unexplored coordinates.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

### Assumptions made *before* moving to (0, 2)

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato seen. |
| 2 | Moving to (0, 2) might bring the potato into view. | **Disproved** – view shows only the table (empty). |
| 3 | The table remains at (0, 3) and stays empty. | **Confirmed** – table is visible and still empty. |
| 4 | The key stays at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – key still exists (out of view). |
| 5 | The door stays closed & unlocked at (4, 4). | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |
| 6 | Inventory stays empty. | **Confirmed** – no items taken. |

---

### Summary (short)

- You are now at (0, 2) and can see the empty table at (0, 3).  
- The potato has not been found; its existence remains unverified.  
- All previously known facts (key location, door state, empty inventory) are still true.  
- The only assumption that failed was that the potato would be visible from this spot.  

**Next minimal step:** `look_around` at (0, 2) to be certain nothing is hidden, then continue systematic search (e.g., move to (0, 0) or (1, 2)).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflection shows you have only **moved** to coordinate (0, 2); the required **look_around** at that spot (and the rest of the grid) has not been performed yet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last reflection shows you have only **moved** to coordinate (0, 2); the required **look_around** at that spot (and the rest of the grid) has not been performed yet. Therefore the current systematic‑exploration step is still pending. **Plan step not completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires a move_to followed by a look_around at each coordinate. The last reflection only shows a move_to to (0,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising – you’ve moved to a new, unexplored tile (0, 2), but you haven’t yet performed the required `look_around` there.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires a move_to followed by a look_around at each coordinate. The last reflection only shows a move_to to (0,2) without a subsequent look_around, so the step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The plan is still promising – you’ve moved to a new, unexplored tile (0, 2), but you haven’t yet performed the required `look_around` there. Adding the `look_around` now will finish this step and let you continue the systematic scan of the remaining coordinates. Proceed with `look_around` at (0, 2) and then keep moving through the grid.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

**Assumptions made before the systematic‑search plan**

| # | Assumption | Verdict (so far) |
|---|------------|------------------|
| 1 | A potato exists somewhere in the room. | **Unverified** – still no potato seen. |
| 2 | Moving to each grid cell (and looking around) will eventually reveal the potato. | **Partially disproved** – the cells visited so far ((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (0,2)) showed nothing. |
| 3 | The key remains at (3, 1). | **Confirmed** – still present (just out of view). |
| 4 | The door stays closed and unlocked. | **Confirmed** – unchanged. |
| 5 | The table stays empty at (0, 3). | **Confirmed** – empty when in view. |
| 6 | Inventory stays empty until the potato is taken. | **Confirmed** – still empty. |

**What the actions proved / disproved (short)**  

- Proven: key location, door state, table emptiness, inventory empty.  
- Disproved: the potato is **not** visible from the coordinates examined so far.  
- Still open: whether a potato exists anywhere in the room.  

**Next minimal step** – perform `look_around` at (0, 2) (to be sure nothing is hidden) and then continue the systematic walk (e.g., move_to (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), …) until the potato appears, after which it can be `take`‑n and `place`‑d on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No.**  
The latest reflection shows only that you have moved to (0, 2) and seen the empty table. The plan’s current step – “move_to each coordinate **and look_around**” – has not yet been fulfilled for this coordinate because the required `look_around` at (0, 2) has not been performed. The next focused step is to execute that `look_around`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No.**  
The latest reflection shows only that you have moved to (0, 2) and seen the empty table. The plan’s current step – “move_to each coordinate **and look_around**” – has not yet been fulfilled for this coordinate because the required `look_around` at (0, 2) has not been performed. The next focused step is to execute that `look_around`.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The latest reflection shows only the move_to (0,2) was done; the required look_around at (0,2) has not been performed, so the focused step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan is still promising – we have only skipped the `look_around` at (0, 2); performing it will continue the systematic search and eventually reveal the potato (if it exists) so the exploration strategy remains viable.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan requires both moving to a coordinate and performing a look_around there. The latest reflection shows only the move_to (0,2) was done; the required look_around at (0,2) has not been performed, so the focused step is not yet completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The plan is still promising – we have only skipped the `look_around` at (0, 2); performing it will continue the systematic search and eventually reveal the potato (if it exists) so the exploration strategy remains viable.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.
