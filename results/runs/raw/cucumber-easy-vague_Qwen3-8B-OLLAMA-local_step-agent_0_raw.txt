Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.5,1.5)
[ACTION EXECUTED] collected cucumber_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Cucumber was at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Table is at (3.5, 0.5).  
- Agent moved to (3.5, 1.5) and collected the cucumber.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Agent now holds the cucumber.  
- Next step: move to table (3.5, 0.5) and drop the cucumber.  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Cucumber was successfully collected (confirmed by "collected cucumber_3").  

**Unproven Assumptions:**  
- Agent will move to the table and drop the cucumber (not yet executed).

[observer] You are holding the cucumber and are positioned at (3.5, 1.5). The table is directly south at (3.5, 0.5) with empty contents. No obstacles or conflicts detected. Move to the table and drop the cucumber to complete the task.
