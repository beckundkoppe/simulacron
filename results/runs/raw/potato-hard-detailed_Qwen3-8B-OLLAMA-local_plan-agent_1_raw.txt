- The door (door_8) is open and leads to the main room.  

**Relevant Discovery:**  
The **chest** is the only container in the room with unconfirmed contents. Since the potato was confirmed to be in this room, it is **likely inside the chest** (as it is the only hidden object). The chest’s lock is unlocked, so it can be opened.  

**Next Action:** Open the chest to retrieve the potato.

**Facts:**

- Chest_12 contains "1" (unknown item, likely the potato).  
- Box_11 (diamond) and door_8 (open) are in the room.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Chest_12 contains the potato (validated).  
- No obstacles block access (unvalidated).  
- Key_7 was unnecessary for the door but valid for the chest (proven mixed).  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Validated:** Chest_12 is open.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Collected** potato_9 from chest_12 (which was empty).  
- **Moved to (0,4)** (table location).  
- **Dropped** potato_9 on table (shelf_13).  

**Facts:**  
- Potato_9 is now on the table (shelf_13).  
- Chest_12 is open and empty (no potato visible).  
- Box_11 contains a diamond.  
- Door_8 is open (leads to main room).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- **Potato_9 was in chest_12** (proven **wrong**; chest was empty).  
- **No obstacles** (unvalidated; potato placement succeeded).  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Validated:** Potato_9 is on the table.  
- **Proven Wrong:** Chest_12 contained the potato (chest was empty).  
- **Unvalidated:** No obstacles; potato placement succeeded.  

**Final Outcome:** The potato was successfully placed on the table despite the chest being empty. The assumption about the chest containing the potato was incorrect, but the goal was achieved.  

**Final Answer:** The potato is already on the table.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- The potato was placed on the table (shelf_13).  
- The chest (chest_12) is open and contains the key (key_7).  

**Facts:**  
- **Potato_9 is on the table (shelf_13)**.  
- **Chest_12 is open and empty** (no potato or key visible).  
- **Key_7 was dropped into chest_12** (now contains key_7).  

**Assumptions About the New State:**  
- **Potato_9 was in chest_12** (proven **wrong**; chest was empty).  
- **Key_7 was in chest_12** (proven **correct**; key was placed there).  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Validated:** Potato_9 is on the table.  
- **Proven Wrong:** Chest_12 contained the potato (chest was empty).  
- **Validated:** Key_7 was placed in chest_12.  

**Final Answer:** The potato is already on the table.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions**:  
- **Collected potato_9 from shelf_13 (table)**.  

**Facts**:  
- **Potato_9 is on shelf_13**.  
- **Chest_12 (on shelf_13) contains key_7**.  
- **User’s inventory is empty**.  

**Assumptions About the New State**:  
1. **Potato_9 was in chest_12** → **Proven wrong** (chest only has key_7).  
2. **Key_7 was in chest_12** → **Proven correct** (key is there).  

**Proven Right/Wrong**:  
- **Validated**: Potato_9 is on the table (shelf_13).  
- **Proven Wrong**: Chest_12 contained the potato (chest is empty of potato).  
- **Validated**: Key_7 was placed in chest_12.  

**Final State**: Goal achieved (potato on table; key in chest).  

**Final Answer**: The potato is already on the shelf.
