[reflector] **Effect of Action:**
Player moved from (2.0,2.0) to chest_5 location

**Facts:**
- Player moved to chest_5 location
- Chest_5 is open and unlocked at (2.0, 2.0)

**Assumptions about new state:**
- Chest contained items/loot
- Chest was previously closed
- Player gained access to chest contents

**Assumptions proven right:**
- Chest was accessible and openable
- Movement to chest location was successful

**Assumptions proven wrong:**
- No loot found in chest
- No information about chest contents or player inventory changes
- Chest state before opening not confirmed (assumed closed)
