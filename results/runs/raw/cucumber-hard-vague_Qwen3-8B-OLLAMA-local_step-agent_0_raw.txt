[reflector] **Facts:**  
- The cucumber was moved to the agent's location (3.5,1.5).  
- The cucumber is now in the agent's inventory.  
- The table remains empty and accessible.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The path to the cucumber was unobstructed (proven correct).  
- The table is accessible (proven correct).  

**Unresolved:**  
- The cucumber has not yet been placed on the table.  
- The agent must now move to the table and drop the cucumber to complete the task.
