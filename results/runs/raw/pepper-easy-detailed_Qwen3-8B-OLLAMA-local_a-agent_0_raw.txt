[observer] I observe three peppers in the main room:  
- **pepper_4** at (3.0, 1.5)  
- **pepper_3** at (3.5, 1.5)  
- **pepper_5** at (3.5, 1.0)  

The **table** (table_6) is at (3.5, 0.5) and currently empty. All peppers are in the same room and accessible. No other objects or obstacles are present.

Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit).

[action_imaginator] Take pepper_5.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to (3.5, 1), which is near pepper_5 (3.5, 1.0).  
- Collected **pepper_5** (now in inventory).  

**Facts:**  
- **pepper_5** is no longer at (3.5, 1.0) (it is collected).  
- **pepper_3** (3.5, 1.5) and **pepper_4** (3.0, 1.5) remain uncollected.  
- **Table_6** at (3.5, 0.5) is still empty.  

**Assumptions:**  
1. Movement to (3.5, 1) would allow collection of pepper_5 (proven correct).  
2. No obstacles block access to other peppers (assumed true, as environment is unobstructed).  

**Corrected Assumptions:**  
- The agent’s current position (3.5, 1) is valid for subsequent movements (e.g., north to collect pepper_3, west to collect pepper_4).  

**Next Steps:**  
Collect pepper_3 → collect pepper_4 → move to table_6 → place all peppers on the table.

[observer] I observe that **pepper_3** is directly north at (3.5, 1.5) and **pepper_4** is west at (3.0, 1.5). The **table_6** is south at (3.5, 0.5). No obstacles block movement. New discovery: the table is reachable from all pepper positions via straight lines. Next, collect pepper_3 (north), then pepper_4 (west), then move to table_6 (south) to place all peppers.
