content='Thoughts:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state and task:\n1. The human is in a room called "main" with dimensions extend_x = 5.0 and extend_y = 5.0.\n2. Current position: x=0.5, y=0.5\n3. Inventory contains one item: carrot with id \'carrot_4\'\n4. Perception shows there is a table with id \'table_3\' at position (1.0, 4.0) and it\'s empty.\nThe task says "move x +0.5". So I need to calculate the new position after moving:\nCurrent x = 0.5\nMove x by +0.5: 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\nSo, new coordinates would be (1.0, current y which is 0.5)\nBut before moving, I should check if the destination position is valid within room boundaries.\nRoom extends from x=0 to x=5 and y=0 to y=5 so new position (1.0, 0.5) is within bounds.\n\nThe task only asks for a movement action. So first toolcall would be move_to_position with x=1.0 and current y=0.5.\n\nBut wait - the problem says "move x +0.5" which implies only changing the x position by delta +0.5 while keeping y same at 0.5. So the correct toolcall is to set new position (1.0, 0.5).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    "toolcalls": [\n        {\n            "name": "move_to_position",\n            "parameters": {\n                "x": "1.0",\n                "y": "0.5"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 385, 'prompt_tokens': 1087, 'total_tokens': 1472, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-46', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b024c-ad4b-7731-899d-801f98ec29fd-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1087, 'output_tokens': 385, 'total_tokens': 1472, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}

[action_imaginator] move north

content='Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible tool call corresponding to moving north towards the identified table in the northern direction of the room is:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_3"}}\n```\n\nHowever, if interpreting "move north" strictly as increasing the y-coordinate without targeting a specific object, then the following would be appropriate:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_position": {"x": "0.5", "y": "1.5"}}\n```\n\nGiven the context of available objects and typical problem setups, moving towards the northernmost known object (the table) is likely intended.\n\nBut to match exactly with the instruction "move north", which in coordinate free terms means increase y, then move_to_position would be correct if we\'re not targeting an object but just directionally moving.\n\nGiven the lack of specific target coordinates or additional context favoring either interpretation, and since tools allow both modes, but the problem mentions perception details (table\'s position), likely expecting to interact with that object in movement-related tasks.\n\nBut strictly for "move north" without further qualifiers, direction-based movement is `move_to_position`.\n\nHowever, in many contexts like games or spatial problems, moving towards an object in a general direction is often the expected interpretation of such commands when objects are present.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since both tools are available, but only one involves objects (and table is in north direction), likely intended answer is move to object.\n\nFinal conclusion: the correct toolcall is:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_3"}}\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nThe task was interpreted as moving towards an object located in the northern direction relative to the current position. The table, being at (1.0, 4.0) and given that the initial y-coordinate is 0.5, is in the north direction. Therefore, the appropriate action is to move to this object using its identifier.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "table_3"}}\n\n```\n\n(Note: In actual problem solving contexts without real time clarification, `move_to_position` could also be reasonable if moving purely north along y-axis is strictly intended over approaching any northern object. But given objects are in the perception data and movement towards them often matches high level commands like \'move north\', the move_to_object response is more likely correct here.)\n\nIf strict coordinate-based movement north was required without object targeting, then coordinates would need to be calculated as (x=current_x, y=new_y) where new_y > current_y. In absence of specific delta or bounds, a nominal step like y += 1 could be taken. But given tools and typical usage, object-based movement seems more plausible expected answer in such contexts.\n\nHence the final boxed/returned toolcall is as for moving to northern object.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3154, 'prompt_tokens': 1083, 'total_tokens': 4237, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-334', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019b024e-9080-7992-9de1-027a39ccbedf-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1083, 'output_tokens': 3154, 'total_tokens': 4237, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
