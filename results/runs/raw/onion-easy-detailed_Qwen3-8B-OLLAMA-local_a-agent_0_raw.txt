Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Collected onion_3**: Onion is now in inventory.  
- **Moved to door_15**: Agent is at door_15's position (hallway, 0,1.75).  
- **Opened door_15**: Door is now open.  
- **Went through door_15**: Agent enters garden.  
- **Dropped onion_3**: Onion is placed in compost (goal achieved).  

**Facts:**  
- Onion is in compost (correct location).  
- Agent is in garden.  
- Door_15 is open and accessible.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Agent can interact with the compost directly.  
- Path to the compost is unobstructed.  

**Proven Correct:**  
- Door_15 is a valid path to the garden (confirmed).  
- Agent can drop the onion in the compost (task completed).  

**Proven Incorrect (if applicable):**  
- None.  

**Summary:** All steps succeeded. Onion is in compost; door_15 is open; agent is in garden. No errors.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Went through door_15 into hallway**: The agent moved from the living room to the hallway via door_15.  
- **Dropped onion_3**: The onion was placed in the hallway (not the garden), which is incorrect since the compost is in the garden.  

**Facts:**  
- Onion is in the hallway (not the garden).  
- Door_15 is open and leads to the garden.  
- Compost is in the garden.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- The agent intended to drop the onion in the garden, but mistakenly did so in the hallway.  
- Door_15 directly connects the living room to the garden (not the hallway).  

**Proven Correct/Incorrect:**  
- **Incorrect**: The assumption that door_15 leads to the hallway (not the garden) was wrong.  
- **Correct**: Door_15 is unlocked and accessible.  

**Summary:**  
The onion was dropped in the hallway instead of the garden. The error stems from an incorrect assumption about door_15's location. The correct path requires going through door_15 to the garden, not the hallway.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Collected onion_3**: The onion was successfully picked up from its location (door_15’s position in the living room).  

**Facts:**  
- Onion is now in inventory.  
- Agent is at door_15 (position 4,1.75) in the living room.  
- Compost is in the garden (target location).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- Door_15 connects the living room to the garden (correct path to compost).  
- Dropping the onion in the garden is valid.  

**Proven Correct/Incorrect:**  
- **Correct**: Door_15 leads to the garden (validated).  
- **Incorrect**: Earlier assumption that door_15 led to hallway/living_room (disproven).  

**Summary:**  
The onion was successfully collected. The correct path through door_15 leads to the garden (compost location). No further errors in assumptions. Next step: proceed through door_15 to drop the onion in the garden.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Picked up onion_3 from door_15 (living room).

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to (0,4.5) and opened **door_17**.  
- Went through **door_17** into **kitchen**, then **hallway**.  

**Facts:**  
- **door_17** is open and located at (0,4.5).  
- Current position: **hallway** (near door_17).  
- **Compost** is still in the **garden** (unreached).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
1. **door_17** connects to the **garden** (compost).  
2. No other doors are open to reach the garden.  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Assumption about door_15**: **Wrong** (it leads to hallway/living room, not garden).  
- **Assumption about door_17**: **Pending verification** (needs confirmation if it leads to garden).  

**Next Step:** Check if **door_17** leads to the garden. If yes, proceed to drop the onion; if not, search for another open door.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- Moved to door_15 (0,1.75) to pick up the onion.  
- Attempted to interact with door_23 (0.5,0) but failed due to distance.  

**Facts:**  
- Onion (`onion_3`) is at door_15 (0,1.75).  
- Door_15 is open but leads to hallway/living room (not garden).  
- Door_23 is closed and located at (0.5,0).  
- Current position: (0,1.75).  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
1. Door_23 connects to the garden (compost).  
2. Need to move closer to door_23 to open it.  

**Proven Right/Wrong:**  
- **Assumption about door_15**: **Wrong** (leads to hallway, not garden).  
- **Assumption about door_23**: **Pending** (needs verification).  

**Next Step:** Move closer to door_23 (0.5,0) to interact and open it.
