[reflector] **Effect of the actions**

- The carrot is now on the table at (1.0, 4.0).  
- The table is no longer empty.  
- The human agent is positioned at the table after placing the carrot.

**Assumptions made**

1. The carrot was reachable from the human’s starting location.  
2. The table was empty and could accept the carrot.  
3. The human could move to the table’s coordinates.

**Outcome**

All three assumptions proved correct; the carrot was successfully placed on the table, the table’s state changed from empty to occupied, and the human ended up at the table.
