[reflector] **Facts after the executed action**

| Object | Location | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Human  | (3.5, 1.5) | standing |
| Cucumber | (3.5, 1.5) | on the floor |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5) | empty |

**Assumptions made before the action**

1. The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The table is at (3.5, 0.5) and contains no objects.  
3. Moving to the cucumber’s coordinates is a necessary step toward picking it up.  
4. The human can pick up the cucumber once at that location.  
5. The human can later place the cucumber on the table.

**What proved right**

- The cucumber’s location was correct.  
- The table’s location and emptiness were correct.  
- The human successfully moved to the cucumber’s coordinates.

**What has not yet been verified**

- The human has not yet performed the “pick up” action, so we cannot confirm that the cucumber is now in the human’s possession.  
- The human has not yet performed the “place on table” action, so the cucumber remains on the floor.

**Next minimal actions to achieve the goal**

1. `pick up cucumber` (now that the human is at the cucumber).  
2. `move to (3.5, 0.5)` (to the table).  
3. `place cucumber on table`.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human successfully picked up the cucumber at (3.5, 1.5).  
2. The human moved to the table’s coordinates (3.5, 0.5).  
3. The cucumber was placed on the table, leaving the floor empty.  

**Assumptions that proved right**

- The cucumber was indeed at (3.5, 1.5) and could be picked up.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) was empty and could receive the cucumber.  
- The human moved correctly to the table’s location.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- None; all assumptions held true.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- The human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The cucumber remains in the human’s possession (no pick‑up or place action was executed).  
- The table is still empty.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human can move to the table’s coordinates.  
2. The human continues to hold the cucumber after moving.  
3. The table remains empty until a place action is performed.

**Assumptions that proved right**

- The human successfully moved to the table.  
- The cucumber stayed with the human.  
- The table stayed empty.

**Assumptions that proved wrong**

- None. All assumptions held.
