Goal: Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [16] Find the cucumber, pick it up and place it on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed. The task requires three distinct subgoals: locating the cucumber, picking it up, and placing it on the table. A single-step plan lacks the granularity needed for the agent to execute the task systematically. Decomposing into separate actions ensures each step is actionable and avoids ambiguity. 

**Answer:** No, the plan tree needs decomposition into individual steps (e.g., "Find cucumber," "Pick up cucumber," "Place cucumber on table") to enable execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refined Plan:**  
1. **Locate the cucumber** (search environment for cucumber).  
2. **Pick up the cucumber** (interact with cucumber).  
3. **Place the cucumber on the table** (navigate to table and drop).  

This decomposition ensures minimal steps while maintaining logical order: locate → pick up → place. No pruning is needed, as all steps are critical.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed. The steps "Locate the cucumber," "Pick up the cucumber," and "Place the cucumber on the table" form a logical sequence of actions. Each step is actionable and assumes the agent can move to required locations implicitly (e.g., moving to the cucumber's location during "Locate," then to the table during "Place"). No additional steps are needed for movement, as the environment allows the agent to navigate rooms and objects. The decomposition is minimal and directly aligned with the goal.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] You observe that the table at (3.5, 0.5) is empty and within reach. The cucumber is in your inventory. No new obstacles or changes detected. Proceed to place the cucumber on the table.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] Move to (3.5, 0.5) to place the cucumber on the table.

Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
