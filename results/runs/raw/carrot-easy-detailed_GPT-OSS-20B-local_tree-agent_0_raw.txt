Goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [176] Place the carrot from your inventory on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The single node “Place the carrot from your inventory on the table” is still a high‑level goal.  
To execute it we must first confirm that the carrot is indeed in the human’s inventory, that the human is standing on or next to the table, and that the table is accessible for placing an object. These checks and the actual “place” action need to be broken down into separate sub‑steps before the plan can be executed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan node completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The reflection confirms that the agent has successfully moved to the table (now at `table_3`), the carrot is still in the inventory, and the table remains empty. Since the move action has been executed and its outcome matches the expected state, the focused plan node “Move to table” is completed.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] No new discoveries.

[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer, but explicit). Stick closely to the next step in the plan. But always tell the next action

[action_imaginator] ```json
{
  "action": "place",
  "object": "carrot",
  "location": "table"
}
```

[user] {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 5.0, "extend_y": 5.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 1.0, "y": 4.0}}, "your_inventory": [{"name": "carrot", "id": "carrot_4"}], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_3", "position": "(1.0,4.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}]} Reasoning: ```json
{
  "action": "place",
  "object": "carrot",
  "location": "table"
}
``` Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
