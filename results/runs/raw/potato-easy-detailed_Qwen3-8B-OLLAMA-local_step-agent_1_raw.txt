[reflector] **Facts:**  
- Moved to (4,4).  
- Went through door_6 into a chamber (door was open).  

**Assumptions:**  
- The chamber is the "other room" where the potato is located.

**Validated Assumptions:**  
- The door was open, confirming access to the chamber.  
- **Unvalidated:** Whether the potato is in the chamber.

Check if the potato is in the chamber. If yes, take it and place it on the table. If not, search further.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts After Actions:**  
- **Potato_7** is in your inventory.  
- **Table_5** is at (0.0, 3.0) in the main room.  
- You moved to (0,0) (not the table's location).  

**Assumptions About the New State:**  
- **Invalidated:** Moving to (0,0) was incorrect; the table is at (0.0, 3.0).  
- **Validated:** The potato is in your inventory and can be placed on the table.  

**Goal Status:**  
- **Not Fully Achieved:** The potato is not yet on the table (you are at (0,0), not (0.0, 3.0)).  

**Next Step:**  
Move to (0.0, 3.0) and drop the potato on the table.  

**Final Answer:**  
The potato is in your inventory, but you are not at the table's location (0.0, 3.0). Move there and place it on the table. ⚠️
