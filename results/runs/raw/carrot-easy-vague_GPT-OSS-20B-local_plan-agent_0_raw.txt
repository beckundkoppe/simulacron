[reflector] **Effect of the actions**

- The carrot is now on the table at (1.0, 4.0).  
- The table is no longer empty.  
- The human is standing at (1.0, 4.0) and is not holding any object.  
- The carrot’s former location is now empty.  

**Assumptions made**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The table was empty. | Correct – the carrot was placed there. |
| The carrot was reachable and could be picked up. | Correct – the human successfully picked it up. |
| The human could place the carrot on the table. | Correct – the carrot is now on the table. |
| The human’s inventory can hold the carrot. | Correct – the carrot was transferred from inventory to table. |

All assumptions proved true; the new state matches the intended goal.
