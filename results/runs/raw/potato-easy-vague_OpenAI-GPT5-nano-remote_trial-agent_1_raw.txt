Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [0] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief): The current plan is just a single high‑level goal. To execute it, you must break it into concrete, stepwise actions that handle different starting conditions (e.g., where the potato is, whether you’re already holding it, and your position relative to the table). Without these substeps, the plan cannot run reliably.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed.

Recommended minimal decomposition (covering common cases):

- If already holding the potato and at the table: Drop potato on the table.
- Else:
  - If not holding the potato: Move to the potato → Take potato.
  - Move to the table → Drop potato on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The step “Ensure potato is in hand” presumes you know where the potato is and that you can pick it up from anywhere. There is no explicit subplan for locating and retrieving the potato. Without a path to acquire the potato, you may fail to execute correctly. Therefore the plan is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed.

Suggested decomposition (minimal extra steps):
- If potato is not in hand:
  - Move to the potato
  - Pick up potato
- Move to the table
- Place potato on the table

Alternatively, expand [0.1] into:
- 0.1.1 Move to potato
- 0.1.2 Pick up potato
- 0.2 Move to table
- 0.3 Place potato on table

This ensures a complete, actionable sequence from any starting position.

[decompose_imaginator] Concise refinement suggestions:

- Prune rule retained:
  - [0] Place potato on the table
    - [0.0] Precondition: If potato is already on the table, prune (goal achieved).

- Split the remaining flow into two branches based on whether the potato is in hand:
  - Branch A (potato in hand):
    - [A1] Move to the table
    - [A2] Place potato on the table
  - Branch B (potato not in hand):
    - [B1] Move to potato
    - [B2] Pick up potato
    - [B3] Move to table
    - [B4] Place potato on the table

- Decompose 0.1 into conditional:
  - If in hand -> follow Branch A
  - If not in hand -> follow Branch B

This eliminates the unconditional “Move to the table” step and ensures the plan only performs actions necessary to obtain and place the potato.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning: The plan only instructs moving to the table and placing, but does not ensure the agent actually has the potato to place. If the potato isn’t on the table, you must pick it up first (and you typically need to move to the potato before taking it). Therefore the plan isn’t sufficiently decomposed.

Yes, it should be decomposed as:
- If potato is on the table -> goal achieved (do nothing)
- Else:
  - Move to potato
  - Take potato
  - Move to table
  - Place potato on table

This ensures the required preconditions for placing are met with the minimal necessary steps.

Perception: {"you_are_in_room": {"name": "main", "room_size": {"extend_x": 4.0, "extend_y": 4.0}, "your_pos": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}}, "your_inventory": [], "your_perception": [{"name": "table", "id": "table_5", "position": "(0.0,3.0)", "contents_count": "empty"}, {"name": "key", "id": "key_4", "position": "(3.0,1.0)"}, {"name": "door", "id": "door_6", "position": "(4.0,4.0)", "state": "closed", "lock_state": "unlocked"}]}
What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] Observations (new facts):
- Table (table_5) at (0.0, 3.0) is empty; no potato on it.
- Your inventory is empty; potato not in inventory.
- No potato observed anywhere in the room.
- Key (key_4) at (3.0, 1.0).
- Door (door_6) at (4.0, 4.0) is closed but unlocked.
- You are at (0.0, 0.0) in the main room.

Relevance for plan:
- Potato not on table; location unknown. You may need to explore (e.g., move toward the door and open it) to locate the potato. Door state indicates you can pass through to search other areas.

[user] 
Plan:
[0.0] Precondition check: Is the potato already on the table? If Yes: Plan pruned; goal achieved.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Simple starting action to begin the naive plan:
- Open door_6

Full naive plan (minimal sequence to achieve placing the potato on the table):
- Open door_6
- Go through door_6
- Move around/explore until you locate the potato
- Take potato
- Return to the main room and go to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0)
- Drop potato on table_5

Note: The precondition check confirms the potato is not already on the table, so exploration is needed to find and fetch it.

[user] Plan:
[0.0] Precondition check: Is the potato already on the table? If Yes: Plan pruned; goal achieved.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The precondition check was performed and showed the potato is not on the table, so the plan hasn’t been pruned and further work (locating the potato and bringing it to the table) is still required. The next minimal step is to explore beyond the current room (e.g., move toward and through the door) to locate the potato. No wasted or repeating actions occurred.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. The precondition check shows the potato is not on the table, so the goal “place a potato on the table” is not yet achieved. We must continue exploring to locate the potato and then place it on the table.

Minimal next actions:
- Open door_6
- Move through door_6 into the adjacent room to search for the potato.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The precondition check would not succeed (potato is not on the table, which we already know), and rechecking the table does not move you toward locating the potato. You’re at door_6, and the next needed step is to explore other areas to find the potato and then bring it to the table. So the plan doesn’t progress toward the goal.

Answer: No.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [8] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Not sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The goal is to place a potato on the table, but you currently have no potato in inventory and the potato’s location is unknown. Without first finding and acquiring a potato, you cannot complete the final “place” action.
- The plan must include subgoals to locate/pick up the potato, then travel to the table, and finally drop the potato on the table. Right now the plan only states "Place a potato on the table," which is not executable given the current state.

Recommended decomposed plan (minimal steps):
- Subgoal 1: Locate the potato
  - If needed: Open door_6, go through to the other room, and search for any potato.
- Subgoal 2: Acquire the potato
  - Take the potato when found (inventory now contains potato).
- Subgoal 3: Return to the table
  - Move to table_5 at (0.0, 3.0).
- Subgoal 4: Place the potato on the table
  - Drop the potato at the table’s location (placing on table_5).

If you want a concrete first action given current state:
- Open door_6 (if closed), go through to explore the other area for the potato.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan decomposition (concise):

- [8] Place a potato on the table
  - [8.1] Locate and obtain a potato
    - [8.1.1] If a potato is visible in the current space, pick it up.
    - [8.1.2] Otherwise, explore via door_6:
      - [8.1.2.1] If door_6 is closed, open it.
      - [8.1.2.2] Go through door_6.
      - [8.1.2.3] Sweep reachable areas in the connected room to find the potato; stop search once found.
    - [8.1.3] If the potato cannot be found in any reachable area, prune (goal not achievable with current knowledge).
  - [8.2] Transport potato to the table
    - [8.2.1] Move to table_5 (0,3).
    - [8.2.2] Place/drop the potato on table_5.

- Pruning notes (when to prune):
  - If potato is found at any point, skip remaining searches and proceed to 8.2.
  - If all reachable areas are exhausted and potato is still not found, prune the plan (goal cannot be achieved given current knowledge).

- Optional efficiency tweak (if you want to reduce back-and-forth): after locating the potato, you can immediately move to table_5 rather than returning to the main room first, if the potato is obtained in a location that allows a direct path to the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- The plan already splits into the essential subgoals: check current space for potato, else explore via door_6, handle door state, search reachable areas, then transport the potato to the table and place it.
- It includes necessary conditionals (potato visible now vs not, door state) and a fallback prune if the potato isn’t found in reachable areas.
- From the current state (at door_6, door closed but unlocked, potato unseen), the plan steps map directly to actions you can take: open/pass through the door, search the other room, pick up the potato if found, then return to table_5 and place it.

Decision:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Suggested minimal immediate actions from current state:
- If door_6 is closed, open it (and then go through it).
- Sweep/search the connected room for the potato; if found, pick it up.
- Return to table_5 (0,3) with the potato.
- Place/drop the potato on table_5.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. The plan is not completed.

Reason: It says to inspect the hinge area (8.1.2) but the door is still closed; hinge inspection requires opening first. The goal to open and pass through door_6 hasn’t been achieved yet.

Minimal next steps to complete: OPEN door_6, then MOVE THROUGH door_6 to search the adjacent area.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. The plan is not completed.

Reason: It says to inspect the hinge area (8.1.2) but the door is still closed; hinge inspection requires opening first. The goal to open and pass through door_6 hasn’t been achieved yet.

Minimal next steps to complete: OPEN door_6, then MOVE THROUGH door_6 to search the adjacent area.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: Inspecting the hinge while the door is closed cannot change the state; you must OPEN door_6 first to make progress toward locating the potato. Repeating hinge inspection yields no state change, so the plan isn’t moving toward the goal.

No.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [19] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] No. The plan is not sufficiently decomposed.

Reasoning:
- The goal "Place a potato on the table" assumes you already possess a potato. Currently there is no potato in inventory and none observed anywhere. Without first locating and picking up a potato, you cannot complete the final action.
- The plan tree should include subgoals to locate or obtain the potato, then move to the table and place it.

Suggested decomposed plan (minimal, with conditional flow):
- OPEN door_6
- MOVE through door_6 to search the adjacent area
- If potato is found: TAKE potato
- MOVE to table_5
- PLACE potato on table_5
- If potato not found in explored areas, continue exploring other areas and repeat the search steps as needed (until potato is found or all areas are exhausted)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short): The plan already includes the required sequential actions to reach potential potato locations (open and pass through the door, search the new area) plus conditional branches for if/when a potato is found or not. It’s decomposed enough to start execution.

Decision: Yes. The plan is sufficiently decomposed to start.

Recommended initial actions:
- 20. OPEN door_6
- 21. GO THROUGH door_6
- 22. SEARCH for a potato in the new area

If a potato is found:
- 23. TAKE potato
- 24. MOVE to table_5
- 25. DROP potato on table_5

If not found in that area:
- 26. EXPLORE other connected areas (repeat from 19.x as needed)
- 27. Once potato is found, execute the corresponding [19.4] steps

Proceeding with 20, 21, 22 is the minimal, correct start.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] opened door_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect: door_6 opened; you remain at (4, 4) and can pass through to the adjacent area.
- New facts:
  - door_6 is OPEN
  - You are at (4.0, 4.0)
  - Table_5 (0.0, 3.0) is empty; potato not observed
  - Inventory: empty
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0)
- Assumptions and status:
  - Opening the door was possible (proved true)
  - The prior assumption “Door_6 remains closed but unlocked” is now false (door is open)
  - Potato location remains unknown (still true)
- Short takeaway: Plan to pass through door_6 to search the adjacent area.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The goal was to OPEN door_6. Current state shows door_6 is OPEN at (4.0, 4.0) and you are at the door, so the objective is achieved. The next logical step would be to pass through to search the adjacent area. Would you like to go through now?

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] Went through door_6 into chamber
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: You moved through door_6 into the adjacent chamber; door_6 is now OPEN.

- Current facts:
  - Location: in the chamber beyond door_6.
  - door_6: OPEN.
  - Table_5 (in the main room) remains empty; potato not observed.
  - Inventory: empty.
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Potato location: unknown.

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You can explore the adjacent chamber freely (proved true).
  - The potato location remains unknown (true).
  - The door being OPEN allows passage to search further areas (true).

- Which assumptions were right or wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened and passed through; door_6 is OPEN; potato location remains unknown.
  - Wrong: Any assumption that the inactive state (door CLOSED) persists after opening (no longer relevant).

- Short takeaway: You’re in the chamber beyond door_6. Continue exploring that area to locate the potato.

Plan:
SEARCH for a potato in the new area
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive action sequence to search for the potato in the new area:

- Action 1: Go through door_6 (move from the chamber beyond door_6 to the main room, arriving at (0.0, 0.0)).
- Action 2: Open shelf_10 (at (0.0, 0.0)).
- Action 3: Open chest_9 (inside shelf_10).
- Action 4: Take Potato_7 (into your inventory).

After these actions, Potato_7 should be in your inventory, confirming the potato is found.

  - You are at (0.0, 1.0) in the chamber beyond door_6; door_6 is OPEN.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty; no potato observed there.
  - Inventory is empty.
  - Key_4 remains in the main room at (3.0, 1.0).
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9, which is inside shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
  - Diamond_8 is inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can explore the adjacent chamber freely: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (potato_7 location is known).
  - The door being OPEN allows passage to search further areas: true.

- Which assumptions are right or wrong:
  - Right: You can open/pass through door_6; door_6 is OPEN.
  - Wrong: Potato location remains unknown (it is now known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).

- Short takeaway: The area is accessible; the potato is located in chest_9 on shelf_10 (not in the main room). Consider inspecting chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reasoning:
- The potato is already known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0). Checking supermarkets isn’t applicable in this environment, so the plan as stated cannot be completed there.
- To actually obtain the potato, you need to access chest_9 and retrieve Potato_7.

Minimal next actions to complete the goal:
- OPEN chest_9
- TAKE Potato_7

(Optionally, you could then PLACE Potato_7 on a table if required.)

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] No. Reason: The potato (Potato_7) is already known to be inside chest_9 on shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0). Planning to check supermarkets’ potato aisles won’t move you toward that chest or retrieve the potato, so it doesn’t progress toward the goal. The logical next step is to inspect the chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Suggested next action: Move to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0), OPEN chest_9, TAKE Potato_7.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan currently only says “Place a potato on the table,” but you don’t have a potato in inventory yet. The known potato is inside chest_9 on shelf_10 (0,0). To achieve the goal you must first retrieve it and then place it on the table, which requires multiple sub-actions.

Decision: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended decomposed plan (minimal 5 actions):
- Move from your current position (0,1) to shelf_10 / chest_9 at (0,0).
- Open chest_9 (if needed).
- TAKE potato_7 from chest_9 into your inventory.
- Move through door_6 back into the main room and go to table_5 at (0,3).
- DROP potato_7 on table_5.

If chest_9 is already open, you can skip the OPEN step and go directly to TAKE potato_7.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (short):
- The plan tries to “Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9” before ensuring chest_9 is opened. You cannot take it until the chest is opened. The current order (28.1 before 28.3) is invalid. Other steps are fine, but the preconditions/order need fixing.

Plan is not sufficiently decomposed to start as-is. A corrected decomposition:

- Move to shelf_10 (0,0) via door_6
- Open chest_9 (if closed)
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9
- Return to main room through door_6
- Move to Table_5 (0,3)
- Drop Potato_7 on Table_5

This preserves current facts (door_6 open, potato_7 inside chest_9 on shelf_10, main room/table locations) and fixes the retrieval order.

- The plan tries to “Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9” before ensuring chest_9 is opened. You cannot take it until the chest is opened. The current order (28.1 before 28.3) is invalid. Other steps are fine, but the preconditions/order need fixing.

Plan is not sufficiently decomposed to start as-is. A corrected decomposition:

- Move to shelf_10 (0,0) via door_6
- Open chest_9 (if closed)
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9
- Return to main room through door_6
- Move to Table_5 (0,3)
- Drop Potato_7 on Table_5

This preserves current facts (door_6 open, potato_7 inside chest_9 on shelf_10, main room/table locations) and fixes the retrieval order.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [28] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [29] 28.1 Retrieve Potato_7 from shelf_10 (where it is inside chest_9)
  - [30] 28.2 Move to shelf_10 (0,0) via the main room (through door_6 if needed)
  - [31] 28.3 Open chest_9 (if closed)
  - [32] 28.4 Take Potato_7 from chest_9
  - [33] 29.1 Return to the main room through door_6
  - [34] 29.2 Move to Table_5 (0,3)
  - [35] 29.3 Drop Potato_7 on Table_5
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan (concise and minimal):

- Decompose into 5 actions (removing redundant returns and extra steps):
  - Move through door_6 from the chamber (0,1) to shelf_10/main room (0,0).
  - Open chest_9 if it is closed.
  - Take Potato_7 from chest_9.
  - Move to Table_5 (0,3).
  - Drop Potato_7 on Table_5.

- Branching note:
  - If chest_9 is already open, skip the open step.

Why this is better:
- Eliminates the unnecessary return to the main room after picking up the potato.
- Reduces plan depth and total actions from 7–8 to 5 (or 4 if chest is already open).

Would you like me to proceed with this refined plan, or keep the original ordering but with the same end result?

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution. It covers locating the potato (inside chest_9 on shelf_10), retrieving it, and moving it to the table, with clear substeps for movement, opening the chest, and dropping on the table. However, it isn’t perfectly minimal: there is an unnecessary detour in 28.2 (moving via the main room when you’re already in the chamber beyond door_6) and the 28.1/28.2 split could be streamlined.

Recommended minimal decomposition to execute now:
- Move from your current position (0,1) to shelf_10 (0,0)
- Open chest_9 (if it’s closed)
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9
- Move back to the main room (0,0)
- Move to Table_5 (0,3)
- Drop Potato_7 on Table_5

Notes:
- door_6 is OPEN and you can pass through as needed.
- If chest_9 is already open, skip the “open chest” step.
- This plan uses the fewest clearly necessary actions given current knowledge.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Here are concise refinements to decompose and prune the current plan for placing Potato_7 on Table_5.

Updated plan structure (two-phase, minimal actions)
- Phase 1: Retrieve Potato_7 from shelf_10
  - [28.1] Move to shelf_10 (0,0) via door_6
  - [28.2] Open chest_9 (if closed)
  - [28.3] Take Potato_7 from chest_9
- Phase 2: Deliver to table_5
  - [29.1] Return to main room through door_6
  - [29.2] Move to Table_5 (0,3)
  - [29.3] Drop Potato_7 on Table_5

Pruning and conditional notes
- If chest_9 is already open, skip 28.2.
- If chest_9 is already open and contains Potato_7, you can skip 28.3 and proceed to 29.1 directly after 28.3.
- The goal is achieved after 29.3; additional steps are unnecessary.

Rationale
- This splits retrieval and placement into clear, minimal actions.
- Allows skipping steps when the chest state is already known/open, reducing actions.

[reflector] - Effect of action: You moved through door_6 (which is OPEN) into the main room; now at (0.0, 0.0) near shelf_10.

- Current facts:
  - Location: main room at (0.0, 0.0).
  - door_6: OPEN (passed through).
  - Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9; chest_9 contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can move through an OPEN door: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (potato_7 location is known).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.

- Which assumptions are right or wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened and passed through; door_6 is OPEN; area beyond is accessible.
  - Wrong: The assumption that the potato location remains unknown (it’s known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).

- Short takeaway: The potato is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Consider inspecting chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. Plan to move to chest_9 and open it.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes. Reason: The planaimed to move to shelf_10 at (0,0) via the main room. You are currently at (0.0, 0.0) in the main room, which is the location of shelf_10, and you know chest_9 (with Potato_7) is there. Therefore the objective of the plan is achieved. Next, you can inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: The planaimed to move to shelf_10 at (0,0) via the main room. You are currently at (0.0, 0.0) in the main room, which is the location of shelf_10, and you know chest_9 (with Potato_7) is there. Therefore the objective of the plan is achieved. Next, you can inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,4.0) to (0.0,3.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of action:
- Moved from (4,4) to (0,3); you are now at the table_5 location in the main room. No object interaction occurred.

Current facts:
- Location: (0.0, 3.0) (at or near table_5).
- Door_6: OPEN and has been passed through.
- Shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9; chest_9 contains Potato_7.
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
- Key_4 in the main room at (3.0, 1.0).
- Table_5 in the main room is empty.
- Inventory: empty.

Assumptions about the new state:
- You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
- The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
- The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
- You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible.

Right vs wrong:
- Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
- Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

Short takeaway:
- Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: inspect chest_9 (e.g., use a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed. Reason: The plan 28.1 aims to retrieve Potato_7. So far you’ve only identified and reached chest_9 on shelf_10; you have not yet retrieved Potato_7 from the chest.

Minimal next actions to complete:
- Move from current position (0.0, 3.0) to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
- Use a step stool to reach shelf_10 and locate chest_9.
- Open chest_9.
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed. Reason: The plan 28.1 aims to retrieve Potato_7. So far you’ve only identified and reached chest_9 on shelf_10; you have not yet retrieved Potato_7 from the chest.

Minimal next actions to complete:
- Move from current position (0.0, 3.0) to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
- Use a step stool to reach shelf_10 and locate chest_9.
- Open chest_9.
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: Potato_7’s location is known (inside chest_9 on shelf_10 in the main room) and the area is accessible. The minimal path to retrieval is to reach shelf_10, open chest_9 if needed, then take Potato_7. No conflicting state has been introduced that would block this.

Minimal action sequence (assuming chest_9 may be closed):
- Move to (0.0, 0.0) to reach shelf_10.
- Open chest_9 (if closed).
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

If chest_9 is already open:
- Move to (0.0, 0.0) to reach shelf_10.
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes. Reason: Potato_7’s location is known (inside chest_9 on shelf_10 in the main room) and the area is accessible. The minimal path to retrieval is to reach shelf_10, open chest_9 if needed, then take Potato_7. No conflicting state has been introduced that would block this.

Minimal action sequence (assuming chest_9 may be closed):
- Move to (0.0, 0.0) to reach shelf_10.
- Open chest_9 (if closed).
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

If chest_9 is already open:
- Move to (0.0, 0.0) to reach shelf_10.
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,3.0) to (0.0,0.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action:
  - Moved from (0.0, 3.0) to (0.0, 0.0); now at shelf_10. No object interaction occurred.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (0.0, 0.0) in the main room near shelf_10.
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9; chest_9 contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Door_6 is OPEN and unlocked (you have passed through earlier).
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Key_4 in the main room at (3.0, 1.0).
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

- Right vs wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
  - Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: inspect chest_9 (use a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Short reasoning: You’re already at shelf_10 (0,0), and chest_9 is on that shelf containing Potato_7. No extra repositioning or step stool is needed. The quickest path to the goal is simply to open chest_9 (if it's closed) and take Potato_7.

Plan verdict: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Minimal action sequence:
- Open chest_9 (if closed).
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Short reasoning: You’re already at shelf_10 (0,0), and chest_9 is on that shelf containing Potato_7. No extra repositioning or step stool is needed. The quickest path to the goal is simply to open chest_9 (if it's closed) and take Potato_7.

Plan verdict: Yes, the plan is still promising.

Minimal action sequence:
- Open chest_9 (if closed).
- Take Potato_7 from chest_9.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (0.0,3.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: Moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0, 3.0) at table_5. No interaction with any object occurred; the plan to retrieve Potato_7 (via a step stool to shelf_10) was not executed.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (0.0, 3.0) at table_5 in the main room.
  - door_6: OPEN (and previously passed through).
  - Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

- Right vs wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
  - Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: move to shelf_10 and inspect chest_9 (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Plan completed? No.

Short reasoning:
- The plan 28.1 aims to retrieve Potato_7 from shelf_10 inside chest_9 using a step stool. So far, you have not moved to shelf_10 or opened chest_9 to retrieve the potato. Therefore the goal has not been achieved yet.

Recommended next minimal actions:
- Move from current location (0.0, 3.0) to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
- Use a step stool to reach chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Open chest_9 and take Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Plan completed? No.

Short reasoning:
- The plan 28.1 aims to retrieve Potato_7 from shelf_10 inside chest_9 using a step stool. So far, you have not moved to shelf_10 or opened chest_9 to retrieve the potato. Therefore the goal has not been achieved yet.

Recommended next minimal actions:
- Move from current location (0.0, 3.0) to shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0).
- Use a step stool to reach chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Open chest_9 and take Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reason: The plan 28.1 requires moving to shelf_10 and inspecting chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. The latest action moved you to table_5 in the main room with no interaction toward shelf_10 or chest_9, so there’s no progress toward the plan.

No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reason: The plan 28.1 requires moving to shelf_10 and inspecting chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. The latest action moved you to table_5 in the main room with no interaction toward shelf_10 or chest_9, so there’s no progress toward the plan.

No.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [39] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan only states the high-level goal “Place a potato on the table.” To execute, we must specify how to obtain the potato (since Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10) and then place it on the table. This requires a concrete sequence: travel to shelf_10, access chest_9, take Potato_7, return to the table, and drop it. The plan should break the goal into those concrete steps.

Proposed decomposition (minimal actions):
1) Move from current position (0,3) to shelf_10 at (0,0).
2) Open chest_9 at shelf_10 (use step stool if needed to reach it).
3) Take Potato_7 from chest_9.
4) Move from (0,0) back to table_5 at (0,3).
5) Drop Potato_7 on table_5.

Notes:
- If chest_9 is already accessible without stool, step 2 remains; otherwise include the stool action as needed.
- After step 5, Potato_7 will be on the table_5 as the final state.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [39] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan to achieve: Place a potato on the table.

Concise decomposition (minimal actions, with a conditional prune):

- Step 1: Move from current location (0,3) to shelf_10 / chest_9 location (0,0).
- Step 2: If chest_9 is not open, Open chest_9.
- Step 3: Take Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.
- Step 4: Move from (0,0) back to the table location (0,3).
- Step 5: Drop Potato_7 on table_5.

Conditional pruning (to keep it minimal):
- If chest_9 is already open, skip Step 2.
- If you somehow already have Potato_7 in inventory, skip Step 3 (though currently Potato_7 is only known to be in chest_9).

Rationale:
- This uses the known Potato_7 in chest_9 on shelf_10 and the table location at (0,3).
- Keeps actions to the minimum needed to physically place the potato on the table.
- Door_6 being OPEN is not required for this route; we operate entirely within the main room.

Estimated action count:
- With chest_9 closed: 5 actions.
- If chest_9 already open: 4 actions.

Would you like me to proceed with this plan, and assume chest_9 is closed (perform Step 2), or skip Step 2 if you want to treat chest_9 as already open?

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The goal is to move the Potato_7 from chest_9 to the main room table. The plan follows a linear sequence with the minimal required conditionals: move to chest_9, open if needed, take the potato if not already in inventory, return to the table, drop it. Given current facts (Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10; chest_9 is accessible; you’re currently at the table and not carrying the potato), this decomposition directly supports execution without extra branches or redundant steps. It appears the plan uses the fewest actions necessary to achieve the goal.

Answer:
- Yes, the plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.
- Expected execution order from the current state:
  1) Move from (0,3) to (0,0) to chest_9 on shelf_10.
  2) Open chest_9 if it is not already open.
  3) Take Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory (if not already in inventory).
  4) Move back from (0,0) to (0,3) at the table_5 location.
  5) Drop Potato_7 on table_5.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,3.0) to (0.0,2.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action: You moved from (0.0, 3.0) to (0.0, 2.0); no object interaction occurred.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (0.0, 2.0) in the main area, en route to shelf_10.
  - door_6: OPEN (still open from earlier).
  - Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

- Right vs wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
  - Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: move to shelf_10 (toward (0,0)) and inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7 (potentially using a step stool).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Not completed.

Reason: The plan’s goal was to move from (0,3) to (0,0) (shelf_10 / chest_9). You have not yet arrived at (0,0) in this plan execution, so Step 1 is still pending.

Minimal actions to complete Step 1 (assuming starting from (0,3)):
- Move from (0,3) to (0,2)
- Move from (0,2) to (0,1)
- Move from (0,1) to (0,0)

If you are already at (0,2) now, skip the first move and do:
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (0,0)

After reaching (0,0), inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Not completed.

Reason: The plan’s goal was to move from (0,3) to (0,0) (shelf_10 / chest_9). You have not yet arrived at (0,0) in this plan execution, so Step 1 is still pending.

Minimal actions to complete Step 1 (assuming starting from (0,3)):
- Move from (0,3) to (0,2)
- Move from (0,2) to (0,1)
- Move from (0,1) to (0,0)

If you are already at (0,2) now, skip the first move and do:
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (0,0)

After reaching (0,0), inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.

Reasoning:
- The target location (0,0) is shelf_10/chest_9. You’ve already moved from (0,3) to (0,2), making progress toward the goal.
- Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10 at (0,0), so reaching that location is the right next action to inspect retrieve it.
- Door_6 is OPEN, so there’s no door barrier to this plan.

Next step (minimal): move from (0,2) to (0,1), then to (0,0) to reach shelf_10/chest_9 and inspect chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.

Reasoning:
- The target location (0,0) is shelf_10/chest_9. You’ve already moved from (0,3) to (0,2), making progress toward the goal.
- Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10 at (0,0), so reaching that location is the right next action to inspect retrieve it.
- Door_6 is OPEN, so there’s no door barrier to this plan.

Next step (minimal): move from (0,2) to (0,1), then to (0,0) to reach shelf_10/chest_9 and inspect chest_9.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,2.0) to (0.0,1.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed action:
  - You moved from (0.0, 2.0) to (0.0, 1.0); no object interaction. You’re still in the main area, en route toward shelf_10. No new potato or diamond observations in this step.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (0.0, 1.0) in the main room (on the way to shelf_10).
  - door_6: OPEN (has been passed through previously).
  - Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

- Which assumptions are right or wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
  - Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: continue moving to shelf_10 (to (0,0)) and inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7 (potentially using a step stool).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning: The plan’s goal is to be at shelf_10/chest_9 (0,0) and inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. Based on the latest state, you have not yet arrived at (0,0) or opened chest_9, so the plan hasn’t been completed yet.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed.

Next steps (suggested):
- Move along the y-axis from your current position to (0,0) to reach shelf_10.
- Inspect chest_9 (using a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.
- Update inventory after retrieving Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning: The plan’s goal is to be at shelf_10/chest_9 (0,0) and inspect chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. Based on the latest state, you have not yet arrived at (0,0) or opened chest_9, so the plan hasn’t been completed yet.

Answer: No, the plan is not completed.

Next steps (suggested):
- Move along the y-axis from your current position to (0,0) to reach shelf_10.
- Inspect chest_9 (using a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.
- Update inventory after retrieving Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes, the plan is still promising, but it needs an update to reflect your current position.

Reasoning:
- Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10.
- You’re already on the path toward shelf_10 and the door is OPEN, so proceeding toward chest_9 remains the right next action.
- The plan as written starts from (0,3); you are now at (0,1) (near the route to shelf_10). Updating the starting point keeps the plan coherent and avoids redundant moves.

Recommended update:
- Step 1: Move from your current location (0.0, 1.0) to shelf_10 / chest_9 location (0.0, 0.0).
- Step 2: Inspect chest_9 (use a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.

Would you like me to proceed with the updated steps?

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes, the plan is still promising, but it needs an update to reflect your current position.

Reasoning:
- Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10.
- You’re already on the path toward shelf_10 and the door is OPEN, so proceeding toward chest_9 remains the right next action.
- The plan as written starts from (0,3); you are now at (0,1) (near the route to shelf_10). Updating the starting point keeps the plan coherent and avoids redundant moves.

Recommended update:
- Step 1: Move from your current location (0.0, 1.0) to shelf_10 / chest_9 location (0.0, 0.0).
- Step 2: Inspect chest_9 (use a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,1.0) to (0.0,0.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of action:
  - Moved from (0.0, 1.0) to (0.0, 0.0); now at shelf_10 location, where chest_9 is.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (0.0, 0.0) in the main room near shelf_10.
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Door_6 OPEN; you have passed through earlier.
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty.
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Inventory: empty.

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

- Right vs wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is now known.
  - Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

- Short takeaway:

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Yes. Plan completed.

Reasoning:
- The plan was to move from (0,3) to (0,0) at shelf_10/chest_9. You moved from (0,3) to (0,0) and arrived at shelf_10, where chest_9 is located.
- We already know Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10, so the objective of reaching the area to access the chest is satisfied.

Next suggested step:
- Inspect chest_9 (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Yes. Plan completed.

Reasoning:
- The plan was to move from (0,3) to (0,0) at shelf_10/chest_9. You moved from (0,3) to (0,0) and arrived at shelf_10, where chest_9 is located.
- We already know Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10, so the objective of reaching the area to access the chest is satisfied.

Next suggested step:
- Inspect chest_9 (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed Actions
- The plan to inspect chest_9 has not yet executed; no chest interaction occurred. You did move to shelf_10 earlier, but chest_9 has not been opened or checked in this step.

Current facts
- Location: at shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0) in the main room.
- Shelf_10 contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
- Door_6 OPEN and unlocked (passed through earlier).
- Table_5 in the main room is empty.
- Key_4 in the main room at (3.0, 1.0).
- Inventory: empty.

Assumptions about the new state
- You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
- The potato location remains unknown: false (Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10).
- The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
- You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible (not yet executed).

Right vs wrong
- Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is known.
- Wrong: Assuming the potato remains unknown.

Short takeaway
- Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Plan next: check chest_9 status; if closed, open chest_9 (possibly using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Reason: The plan requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed, but in the latest perception chest_9 has not been opened or inspected; no chest interaction occurred yet. Next step would be to check chest_9 status and, if needed, open it to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. Reason: The plan requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed, but in the latest perception chest_9 has not been opened or inspected; no chest interaction occurred yet. Next step would be to check chest_9 status and, if needed, open it to retrieve Potato_7.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: You have moved to shelf_10 (0,0), bringing chest_9 into reach. Potato_7 is known to be inside chest_9, so the next required action is to check chest_9’s status and open it if needed. This directly matches Plan Step 2 and there is concrete progress (being at the chest’s location) rather than repeating an already done action.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next: check chest_9’s status; if closed, open chest_9 (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: You have moved to shelf_10 (0,0), bringing chest_9 into reach. Potato_7 is known to be inside chest_9, so the next required action is to check chest_9’s status and open it if needed. This directly matches Plan Step 2 and there is concrete progress (being at the chest’s location) rather than repeating an already done action.

Answer: Yes, the plan is still promising. Next: check chest_9’s status; if closed, open chest_9 (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (3.0,1.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed action
- You moved from (0.0, 0.0) to (3.0, 1.0). No chest interaction occurred this step. You’re now at the location of Key_4 in the main room.

Current facts
- Location: (3.0, 1.0) in the main room (at Key_4).
- door_6 is OPEN and was passed through earlier.
- Shelf_10 at (0.0, 0.0) contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
- Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room (you are there).
- Table_5 in the main room is empty.
- Inventory: empty.

Assumptions about the new state
- You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
- The potato location remains known: true (Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10).
- The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
- You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible but not yet executed.
- Chest_9 status (open/closed) remains unchecked in this action: not determined here.

Right vs wrong
- Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is known.
- Wrong: Assuming chest_9 has been examined or opened in this step (that action was not performed).

Short takeaway
- Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10. Next action: check chest_9’s status and open it if needed to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- Plan Step 2 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed. In the latest perceptions, chest_9’s status has not been observed or updated, and no chest interaction has occurred. Therefore Step 2 has not been executed, so the plan is not completed.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. Next action: check chest_9 status; if it is closed, open chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. If it’s already open, Step 2 is effectively satisfied and the plan would be considered completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- Plan Step 2 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed. In the latest perceptions, chest_9’s status has not been observed or updated, and no chest interaction has occurred. Therefore Step 2 has not been executed, so the plan is not completed.

Answer:
No, the plan is not completed. Next action: check chest_9 status; if it is closed, open chest_9 to retrieve Potato_7. If it’s already open, Step 2 is effectively satisfied and the plan would be considered completed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning: The most recent action moved you to Key_4 without touching chest_9 or opening it, so no state change toward the plan Step 2 occurred. Plan Step 2 hinges on checking chest_9’s status and potentially opening it, which requires moving to shelf_10 and interacting with chest_9. Since you didn’t approach or affect chest_9, the plan isn’t progressing.

Decision: No, the plan is not promising yet.

Suggested next steps to regain progress:
- Move toward shelf_10 to reach chest_9 (e.g., from your current location at (3.0, 1.0) go toward (0.0, 0.0)).
- Check chest_9 status (open/closed).
- If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (potentially using a step stool).
- Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning: The most recent action moved you to Key_4 without touching chest_9 or opening it, so no state change toward the plan Step 2 occurred. Plan Step 2 hinges on checking chest_9’s status and potentially opening it, which requires moving to shelf_10 and interacting with chest_9. Since you didn’t approach or affect chest_9, the plan isn’t progressing.

Decision: No, the plan is not promising yet.

Suggested next steps to regain progress:
- Move toward shelf_10 to reach chest_9 (e.g., from your current location at (3.0, 1.0) go toward (0.0, 0.0)).
- Check chest_9 status (open/closed).
- If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (potentially using a step stool).
- Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [45] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
The current plan only states the final action (placing a potato on the table) and lacks the necessary substeps to obtain the potato and reach the table. To execute, you need subgoals like locating and retrieving Potato_7 from chest_9, handling chest access, navigating to the table, and then placing it. Without these, execution cannot proceed reliably.

Decision:
Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution. Here is a suggested decomposition.

Proposed decomposed plan (high level, actionable steps):
- 45.1: Ensure Potato_7 is in inventory
  - If Potato_7 is not in inventory, move to shelf_10 (0,0) and Chest_9.
  - If Chest_9 is closed, open Chest_9 (use a step stool if needed) to access Potato_7.
  - Pick Potato_7 from Chest_9 and place it into inventory.
- 45.2: Move to the table
  - Move from shelf_10 (0,0) to Table_5 location (0,3) in the main room.
- 45.3: Place potato on the table
  - Place Potato_7 from inventory onto Table_5.
  - Confirm potatoes on the table (inventory becomes empty after placement).

Notes:
- Chest_9 status (open/closed) should be checked at 45.1; if already open, skip the open step.
- If for some reason you cannot reach Chest_9 (e.g., no stool), document the constraint and adjust (e.g., retrieve and place later).
- This plan assumes you can carry Potato_7 in inventory and that movement between these locations is possible with OPEN door_6.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Refined plan decomposition (to execute the goal: place a potato on the table)

Plan 1: Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9 on shelf_10
- 1.1 Move to shelf_10 (0,0) from current location.
- 1.2 Inspect chest_9 status.
- 1.3 If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (step stool may be needed if accessibility is constrained).
- 1.4 Pick up Potato_7 from chest_9 into your inventory.

Plan 2: Place Potato_7 on Table_5
- 2.1 Move to Table_5 (0,3).
- 2.2 Place Potato_7 on the table (inventory becomes empty).

Notes and guardrails
- If chest_9 is already open, skip 1.3.
- If stepping stool is required, treat 1.1–1.4 as contingent on reachability.
- If at any point you cannot access chest_9, prune plan 1 and reassess alternative potato sources (none known in current context).

This decomposes the single goal into a concrete retrieval followed by placement, with clear gates and optional fallbacks.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan splits the task into a retrieval phase (1.1–1.4) and a placement phase (2.1–2.2), with a clear contingency (1.3) if chest_9 is closed. The prerequisites are known (potato is in chest_9 on shelf_10; chest_9 exists; door_6 is open; you’re at Key_4 and can move toward shelf_10). This makes it reasonable to start execution.

Decision:
- Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Notes:
- You can begin with 1.1 Move to shelf_10 (0,0) from your current location, then proceed to 1.2 Inspect chest_9 status.
- If 1.2 shows chest_9 closed, follow 1.3 Open chest_9 (use step stool if needed) and then 1.4 Pick up Potato_7.
- After obtaining Potato_7, proceed to 2.1 Move to Table_5 and 2.2 Place Potato_7 on the table.

- You can begin with 1.1 Move to shelf_10 (0,0) from your current location, then proceed to 1.2 Inspect chest_9 status.
- If 1.2 shows chest_9 closed, follow 1.3 Open chest_9 (use step stool if needed) and then 1.4 Pick up Potato_7.
- After obtaining Potato_7, proceed to 2.1 Move to Table_5 and 2.2 Place Potato_7 on the table.

[leaf_selector] [46] Plan 1: Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9 on shelf_10

Justification: This directly advances the goal of placing a potato on the table by first obtaining Potato_7. It covers moving to shelf_10, checking chest_9 status, opening if needed (with stool contingencies), and picking up Potato_7. This sets up the subsequent steps to place the potato on Table_5.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] - Observations (new):
  - You are at main room position (3.0, 1.0) at Key_4; Key_4 is at your location.
  - Table_5 at (0.0, 3.0) is empty.
  - Door_6 is OPEN and unlocked at (4.0, 4.0) (still).
  - Inventory remains empty.
  - No potato observed in this perception.
  - No observation of chest_9 or shelf_10 in this perception (chest_9 status not confirmed here).

- Relevance for plan node:
  - Plan Step 2: Check chest_9 status and open it if closed to retrieve Potato_7 (chest_9 known to contain it).

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10; next action: inspect chest_9.

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Naive human-only plan to retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9 on shelf_10

- Action 1: Move from your current location (3.0, 1.0) to chest_9 on shelf_10 (coordinates ~0.0, 0.0).
- Action 2: If chest_9 lid is closed, use a step stool to reach it.
- Action 3: Open chest_9.
- Action 4: Reach in and take Potato_7 from chest_9.

Single simplest action to archive it (assuming you’re at chest_9 or are performing the key step):
- Open chest_9 and retrieve Potato_7.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3.0,1.0) to (0.0,0.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] Effect of performed action:
- You moved from (3.0, 1.0) to (0.0, 0.0) and are now at shelf_10 (the chest area). No chest interaction occurred this step.

Current facts after the move:
- Location: (0.0, 0.0) near shelf_10.
- Shelf_10 contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
- Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
- Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
- Door_6 OPEN and unlocked; you have passed through earlier.
- Table_5 in the main room is empty.
- Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
- Inventory: empty.

Assumptions about the new state (status):
- You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
- The potato location remains known: true (Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10).
- The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
- You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible but not yet executed.
- Chest_9 status (open/closed) remains unchecked in this action: not determined here.

Right vs wrong:
- Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is known.
- Wrong: Assuming chest_9 has already been examined or opened in this step (this action did not perform that).

Short takeaway:
- Potato_7 is located in chest_9 on shelf_10. Next action: inspect chest_9 (open if closed, possibly with a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7. Plan 1 remains valid.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning before deciding:
- Plan 1 requires physically opening chest_9 and then picking Potato_7.
- In the latest state, chest_9 has not been opened and Potato_7 has not been retrieved (inventory still empty).
- Therefore the goal (retrieve Potato_7) has not been achieved yet.

Answer: No, Plan 1 is not completed. Next action: navigate to shelf_10, inspect chest_9, open it if needed, and then pick Potato_7 (adding it to inventory).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning:
- Plan 1 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it to retrieve Potato_7.
- The latest actions did not open chest_9 or modify the chest’s state, so there has been no progress toward retrieving Potato_7.
- Although Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9, you still need to interact with chest_9 to make progress; repeated moves without chest interaction do not advance the plan.

Answer: No

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning:
- Plan 1 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it to retrieve Potato_7.
- The latest actions did not open chest_9 or modify the chest’s state, so there has been no progress toward retrieving Potato_7.
- Although Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9, you still need to interact with chest_9 to make progress; repeated moves without chest interaction do not advance the plan.

Answer: No

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [55] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
No. The current plan “Place a potato on the table” assumes the potato is already in inventory, but right now the inventory is empty and chest_9’s status is unknown. You must fetch Potato_7 from chest_9 first, then move to the table and place it. The plan needs a retrieval subplan and path actions before the final placement.

Suggested decomposed plan (plan 55) to start execution:
- 55.1 Acquire Potato_7
  - 55.1.1 Move to shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0) where chest_9 is.
  - 55.1.2 Check chest_9 status; if closed, open chest_9 (may require using a step stool).
  - 55.1.3 Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9 and place into inventory.
- 55.2 Move to the table
  - 55.2.1 Move to Table_5 location (0.0, 3.0).
- 55.3 Place Potato_7 on the table
  - 55.3.1 Put Potato_7 from inventory onto Table_5.
- 55.4 Confirm completion
  - 55.4.1 Verify Table_5 has the potato; inventory is updated (or empty if placed).

Notes:
- If chest_9 is already open, skip 55.1.2 and proceed with 55.1.3.
- If any step is blocked (e.g., inability to reach chest_9), consider using a step stool or alternate path, but keep the same retrieval-first ordering.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Plan refinement for current goal: Place a potato on the table.

Concise decomposition (practical steps with pruning options)

- [55] Retrieve Potato_7 from chest_9 (in chest_9 on shelf_10)
  - [55.1] Move to chest_9 / the chest area on shelf_10.
  - [55.2] If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use step stool if needed).
  - [55.3] Pick Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.
  - Pruning options:
    - If chest_9 is already open and Potato_7 is reachable, skip [55.2] and go directly to [55.3].
    - If Potato_7 is already in inventory for any reason, skip [55.3].

- [56] Move to Table_5 (the target location for placement)
  - [56.1] Travel from shelf_10 area to Table_5 (path via open door_6 is available).

- [57] Place Potato_7 on Table_5
  - [57.1] Drop or set Potato_7 onto Table_5 (inventory becomes empty).

Optional optimization (when chest_9 status is known)
- If Chest_9 is open and Potato_7 is already accessible without extra steps, merge [55] and [56] into a single flow: go to chest_9, pick Potato_7, then proceed to Table_5.

Preconditions and notes
- Door_6 is open and unlocked, so passage between regions is available.
- The potato location is known (Potato_7 in chest_9 on shelf_10); chest_9 status is not guaranteed to be open in this step, so include an optional open action.
- Step stool availability is assumed for reaching chest_9 if needed.

Next action recommendation
- Execute [55] sub-steps to fetch Potato_7, then [56] to move to Table_5, and finally [57] to place Potato_7 on the table.
- If chest_9 is found open during [55.2], you can skip to [55.3] and proceed directly to [56].

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The current plan ends with picking Potato_7 into inventory but does not include the final steps to move to the table and place it there, which is required to complete the top-level goal.
- Step 57 handles opening chest_9 if needed, which is good, but without subsequent steps to transport the potato to the table, execution cannot finish.
- The plan is conditionally sound (open chest if needed), but it’s not fully decomposed to achieve the goal in one execution.

Decision: No, the plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

Recommended expanded plan tree:
- [55] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [56] Move to chest_9 / chest area on shelf_10.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [55] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [56] [55.1] Move to chest_9 / the chest area on shelf_10.
  - [57] [55.2] If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use step stool if needed).
  - [58] [55.3] Pick Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.
Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] Concise refinement suggestions for the plan

- Prune redundant step
  - Remove [56] Move to chest_9 / chest area, since you are already at shelf_10 near chest_9. Start with checking chest_9 status immediately.

- Refined plan decomposition
  - [55] Place a potato on the table. (current goal focus)
  - [56] Inspect chest_9 status at shelf_10 (is it open or closed?).
  - [57] If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use a step stool if needed).
  - [58] Pick Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.
  - [59] Move to Table_5 (0.0, 3.0).
  - [60] Place Potato_7 on Table_5.

- Conditional pathing for efficiency
  - If chest_9 is already open when inspecting (56), skip [57] and proceed to [58].
  - If you can reach Potato_7 immediately (58) without opening (e.g., chest is open), you can skip [57].

- Rationale
  - We already know Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10, so the first actionable step is to verify chest_9’s status directly rather than moving to it. Then retrieve, then move to the table to complete the goal.

- Optional alternative branching (for robustness)
  - If chest_9 cannot be opened due to access constraints, you could add a fallback: attempt to locate any detachable method to retrieve Potato_7 or re-evaluate the plan, but this should be clearly marked as a rare exception.

Goal: Place a potato on the table.
Current plan tree:
- [55] Place a potato on the table. (current focus)
  - [57] [55.2] If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use step stool if needed).
  - [58] [55.3] Pick Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- The goal is to place Potato_7 on the table, but the current plan would place it only after picking it, and there are no explicit movement steps. To execute reliably, we must:
  - Ensure we actually have Potato_7 in inventory.
  - Navigate to chest_9 and open it if needed.
  - Pick Potato_7 into inventory.
  - Move to the table.
  - Place the potato on the table.
- As written, the plan lacks explicit navigation steps and has the order potentially reversed (placing before securing the potato). It also leaves chest_9’s open/closed status uncontrolled in the execution path.

Verdict: Not sufficiently decomposed to start execution yet.

Recommended decomposed plan (more explicit and ordered):
- 55: Goal: Place Potato_7 on Table_5 (requires Potato_7 in inventory).
  - 55.1 If Potato_7 is not in inventory, proceed to retrieve it:
    - 55.1.1 If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use a step stool if needed).
    - 55.1.2 Pick Potato_7 from chest_9 into inventory.
  - 55.2 Move to the table (Table_5 at 0.0, 3.0).
  - 55.3 Place Potato_7 on Table_5.

Optional refinements:
- Include a check to confirm chest_9 status after attempting to open it.
- If multiple steps are needed to navigate (e.g., obstacles), insert explicit move steps between chest and table.

In short: No, the current plan isn’t ready to execute. A decomposed sequence that ensures potato retrieval before placement and explicit movement actions is needed.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] 57 — Open chest_9 if closed (use a step stool if needed). Justification: Chest_9 status is not confirmed here, and you cannot pick Potato_7 until the chest is open. Opening it now enables the next leaf task [58] to retrieve Potato_7.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] Observations (new discoveries, verified facts only):
- You are at the main room origin: (0.0, 0.0).
- Table_5 (0.0, 3.0) is empty; no potato observed.
- Key_4 is at (3.0, 1.0); inventory remains empty.
- Door_6 is OPEN and unlocked at (4.0, 4.0); you could pass through.
- No observation of chest_9 or shelf_10 in this perception; no potato observed.

Relevance for plan node:
- Plan Step 2: Check chest_9 status and open it if closed. Chest_9 status is not confirmed in this perception.

Short takeaway:
- No new potato observation; chest_9 status pending. Next action: inspect chest_9 when at shelf_10.

Plan:
[55.2] If chest_9 is closed, open chest_9 (use step stool if needed).
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] Action: Open chest_9.

Reason: It’s the simplest human action to execute to satisfy Plan Step 2 (check chest_9 status and open if closed). If chest_9 is closed, this will open it (a step stool would only be needed if it’s out of reach).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.0,0.0) to (0.0,0.0)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed action:
  - No movement occurred (you stayed at 0.0, 0.0). No chest interaction happened. Plan to inspect chest_9 was not executed.

- Current facts (after the move):
  - Location: (0.0, 0.0) near shelf_10.
  - Shelf_10 contains chest_9, which contains Potato_7.
  - Potato_7 is inside chest_9 on shelf_10.
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).
  - Door_6 OPEN and unlocked (passed through earlier).
  - Table_5 in the main room is empty; Inventory is empty.
  - Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
  - Chest_9 status remains unconfirmed (not opened in this step).

- Assumptions about the new state (status):
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains known: true (Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible but not yet executed.
  - Chest_9 status (open/closed) remains unchecked in this action: true.

- Which assumptions are right or wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is known.
  - Wrong: Assuming chest_9 has already been examined or opened in this step (that action did not occur).

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10. Next action: check chest_9’s status and open it if closed (likely with a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7. Plan 1 remains valid; this executed action had no effect beyond confirming current positions.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] Short reasoning:
- The plan [55.2] requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed. In the recent steps, chest_9 has not been opened or inspected, and its status remains unchecked. Therefore the plan has not been completed.

Conclusion:
- No, the Plan is not completed.

Next action suggestion:
- Move to shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0), check chest_9’s status. If chest_9 is closed, place a step stool beside it and open the lid to retrieve Potato_7. Update inventory accordingly if retrieval succeeds.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: Short reasoning:
- The plan [55.2] requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if it’s closed. In the recent steps, chest_9 has not been opened or inspected, and its status remains unchecked. Therefore the plan has not been completed.

Conclusion:
- No, the Plan is not completed.

Next action suggestion:
- Move to shelf_10 (0.0, 0.0), check chest_9’s status. If chest_9 is closed, place a step stool beside it and open the lid to retrieve Potato_7. Update inventory accordingly if retrieval succeeds.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes. Reason: In the latest steps you have moved to shelf_10 and Chest_9 is known to contain Potato_7, but chest_9 has not yet been opened or inspected (chest_9 status remains unconfirmed). Plan Step 2 requires checking chest_9 and opening it if closed, which is now feasible since you’re at the correct location and the door remains OPEN. This constitutes progress toward the focused plan, not a repetition with no state change. Next action remains: inspect/open chest_9 (using a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] - Effect of performed action:
  - You moved from (0.0, 0.0) to the door_6 location at (4.0, 4.0). No chest interaction occurred. door_6 is OPEN and unlocked, so you could pass through to the adjacent area beyond the door.

- Current facts:
  - Location: (4.0, 4.0) at door_6.
  - door_6 OPEN and unlocked (passable).
  - Table_5 at (0.0, 3.0) is empty; Key_4 at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room; Inventory: empty.
  - Shelf_10 is still at (0.0, 0.0) containing chest_9, which contains Potato_7; Chest_9 status remains unconfirmed (not opened yet).
  - Diamond_8 inside box_11 at (0.0, 2.0).

- Assumptions about the new state:
  - You can move through OPEN doors and access adjacent areas: true.
  - The potato location remains known: true (Potato_7 is in chest_9 on shelf_10).
  - The area beyond door_6 is accessible for exploration: true.
  - You can reach chest_9 on shelf_10 (e.g., with a step stool): assumed possible but not yet executed.
  - Chest_9 status (open/closed) remains unchecked in this action: true (not opened yet).

- Right vs wrong:
  - Right: Door could be opened/passed; area beyond is accessible; potato location is known.
  - Wrong: Assuming chest_9 has already been examined/opened in this step (that action did not occur).

- Short takeaway:
  - Potato_7 is known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10. Next action: consider passing through door_6 to reach shelf_10 and inspect chest_9 (open it if closed, possibly with a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7. Plan Step 2 remains valid.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] Observations (new discoveries, verified):
- You are in the main room at position (4.0, 4.0).
- Door_6 is open and unlocked at (4.0, 4.0) and passable.
- Table_5 at (0.0, 3.0) is empty; no potato observed.
- Key_4 is at (3.0, 1.0) in the main room.
- Inventory is empty.
- No potato observed in this perception.
- No observation of chest_9 or shelf_10 in this perception; chest_9 status not confirmed here.

Plan relevance:
- Plan Step 2: check chest_9 status and open it if closed. Chest_9 status is not confirmed in this perception.

Short takeaway:
- No new potato observation; chest_9 status pending. Next action: inspect chest_9 when at shelf_10.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] - Brief reasoning: The plan [55.2] requires chest_9 to be closed, then opening it (with a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7. In the latest observations, chest_9’s status is not confirmed and no chest interaction has occurred. Potato_7 remains known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10, but it has not been retrieved. Therefore the plan has not been completed.

- Answer: No, the plan is not completed yet.

- Suggested next action: Move to shelf_10, inspect chest_9; if it is closed, use a step stool to open it and retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: - Brief reasoning: The plan [55.2] requires chest_9 to be closed, then opening it (with a step stool if needed) to retrieve Potato_7. In the latest observations, chest_9’s status is not confirmed and no chest interaction has occurred. Potato_7 remains known to be in chest_9 on shelf_10, but it has not been retrieved. Therefore the plan has not been completed.

- Answer: No, the plan is not completed yet.

- Suggested next action: Move to shelf_10, inspect chest_9; if it is closed, use a step stool to open it and retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Reasoning (brief):
- Plan Step 2 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if closed. In the most recent actions, there was no chest interaction and chest_9’s status remains unconfirmed, so no progress toward retrieving Potato_7 has occurred. We’re currently at or near door_6 with no movement toward shelf_10 to inspect chest_9.

Answer: No

Next action to restore progress:
- Move through door_6 to shelf_10 (location 0,0) and inspect chest_9. If it’s closed, open it (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Reasoning (brief):
- Plan Step 2 requires checking chest_9’s status and opening it if closed. In the most recent actions, there was no chest interaction and chest_9’s status remains unconfirmed, so no progress toward retrieving Potato_7 has occurred. We’re currently at or near door_6 with no movement toward shelf_10 to inspect chest_9.

Answer: No

Next action to restore progress:
- Move through door_6 to shelf_10 (location 0,0) and inspect chest_9. If it’s closed, open it (potentially using a step stool) to retrieve Potato_7.
