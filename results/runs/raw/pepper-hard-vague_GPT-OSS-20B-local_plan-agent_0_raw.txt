[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is now at (3.5, 1).  
- Table (table_6) remains at (3.5, 0.5) and empty.  
- Pepper pepper_3 is still at (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper pepper_4 is still at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Pepper pepper_5 is still at (3.5, 1.0).  
- Apple apple_9 remains at (3.5, 1.6).  
- Potato potato_8 remains at (0.5, 1.5).  
- Chest chest_7 remains at (2.0, 2.0), closed and unlocked.

**Assumptions made**

1. Moving to (3.5, 1) would position the human close enough to pick up the peppers.  
2. No other objects would be moved or affected by the move.

**Which assumptions proved right or wrong**

- **Right**: The human’s position changed to (3.5, 1) as intended; no other objects moved.  
- **Wrong**: The action did not pick up or place any peppers, so the goal “place all peppers on the table” was not achieved.

- Pepper pepper_4: at (3.0, 1.5)  
- Pepper pepper_5: removed from (3.5, 1.0) (now in inventory)  
- Apple apple_9: at (3.5, 1.6)  
- Potato potato_8: at (0.5, 1.5)  
- Chest chest_7: at (2.0, 2.0), closed & unlocked  

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Human is close enough to pick up pepper_3.  
2. Picking up moves the pepper into the human’s inventory.  
3. No other objects moved during the action.  

**Assumptions that proved right**  
- Human’s position is (3.5, 1.5).  
- Pepper_3 is now in inventory.  
- Pepper_5 is still in inventory.  
- No other objects moved.  

**Assumptions that proved wrong**  
- The goal “place all peppers on the table” is still not achieved (table remains empty).

Result: . 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Current facts**

| Object | Location / state |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.5) |
| Inventory | pepper_3, pepper_5 |
| Pepper_4 | (3.0, 1.5) |
| Apple_9 | (3.5, 1.6) |
| Potato_8 | (0.5, 1.5) |
| Chest_7 | (2.0, 2.0), closed & unlocked |
| Table_6 | (3.5, 0.5), empty |

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. Human is close enough to pick up any remaining pepper.  
2. Picking up a pepper moves it into the human’s inventory.  
3. No other objects moved during the actions.

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

| Assumption | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Human is close enough to pick up peppers | **Right** – the human successfully picked up pepper_3 and pepper_5. |
| Pepper_5 is now in inventory | **Right** – inventory contains pepper_5. |
| Pepper_3 is now in inventory | **Right** – inventory contains pepper_3. |
| No other objects moved | **Right** – all other objects remain at their previous locations. |
| Goal “place all peppers on the table” achieved | **Wrong** – table_6 remains empty; peppers are still in inventory. |

**Summary**

The human is at (3.5, 1.5) holding pepper_3 and pepper_5. Pepper_4, apple_9, potato_8, chest_7, and table_6 are unchanged. The only unmet requirement is that the peppers still need to be placed on table_6.
