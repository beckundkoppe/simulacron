[observer] I observe a potato on the table. The table is at position (0.0,3.0) and is currently empty. The potato is the only item on the table. The door at (4.0,4.0) is closed but unlocked. The key is located at (3.0,1.0). 

The potato is relevant to my goal as it's an object I can interact with, though I don't have any inventory items to work with yet. The key and door are also relevant as they represent potential actions I could take.

**Facts:**

**Assumptions proved wrong:**
