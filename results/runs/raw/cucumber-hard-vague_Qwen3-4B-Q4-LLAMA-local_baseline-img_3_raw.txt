[action_imaginator] Take the cucumber from the ground, then move to the table and place it there.  
**Action:** `take cucumber_3 from table_4` (but since it's not in a container, just pick it up first).  
Wait, the cucumber is on the ground, not in a container. So first, **take cucumber_3**, then **put cucumber_3 on table_4**.  

**Correct sequence:**  
1. `take cucumber_3`  
2. `go to table_4`  
3. `put cucumber_3 on table_4`  

But the system might require specifying the container. Since the table is a surface, the final action is `put cucumber_3 on table_4`.
