| Step | Action Description                              | Minimal Action(s) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | Locate the potato in the room.                  | Look for the potato. |
| 2    | Move to the potato’s position.                  | Walk to the potato. |
| 3    | Pick up the potato.                             | Take the potato. |
| 4    | Locate the table in the room.                   | Look for the table. |
| 5    | Move to the table’s surface.                    | Walk to the table. |

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the action**  
- The human agent is now standing at the table’s location (0.0, 3.0).  
- The table remains empty (no potato has been placed on it).  
- The door at (4.0, 4.0) is still closed and unlocked; the key is still at (3.0, 1.0).  

**Assumptions made before the action**  
1. *There is a potato somewhere in the room that can be picked up.*  
2. *Moving to the table is possible and will bring the agent close enough to place the potato.*

**What turned out to be true / false**  
- Assumption 2 was correct: the agent successfully moved to the table.  
- Assumption 1 was false – no potato is currently visible or known to exist in the environment, so the plan to “place a potato” cannot proceed until a potato is obtained.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to locate the potato, but the reflection indicates that no potato is visible or known to exist in the environment, so the potato has not been located yet.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, it still seems promising.**  
We have no potato in the visible area, but the environment contains other locations we haven’t explored yet (e.g., behind the closed door at (4, 4)). By retrieving the key at (3, 1), unlocking/opening the door, and then searching the adjacent space, we may discover a hidden potato. Continuing the search is therefore a viable next step.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The focused step – locating a potato – has **not** been completed.  
We moved to the table, but our perception still shows no potato anywhere in the room, and our inventory is empty. Therefore the plan to find a potato remains unfinished.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to locate a potato, but the current perception shows no potato anywhere in the room and the inventory is empty, so the potato has not been found.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The current room has no visible potato, but the environment may contain other connected spaces (e.g., behind the closed door). Since the door is unlocked, the agent can open it and explore further, where a potato might be located. Therefore the plan to locate a potato is still viable.

**Answer: Yes, it still seems promising.**

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move (0.0, 3.0) → (3.0, 1.0))**

- The human agent is now standing at **(3.0, 1.0)**, the location of the key.  
- The **inventory is still empty** (no object has been taken yet).  
- **Table (0.0, 3.0)** remains empty – no potato has been placed on it.  
- **Door (4.0, 4.0)** is still closed and unlocked.  
- **Key (3.0, 1.0)** is still on the floor at the agent’s feet.  
- **No potato is visible anywhere in the room.**

**Assumptions made before the move**

| Assumption | Was it true? |
|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ Moving from the table to the key’s location is possible. | ✅ True – the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ A potato exists somewhere in the room that could eventually be picked up. | ❌ False – no potato is present or known. |
| 3️⃣ The key can be picked up once the agent is standing on it. | ✅ True (still untested, but the pre‑condition holds). |

**Summary**

The only change caused by the last action is the agent’s position. The goal “place a potato on the table” cannot be pursued yet because the fundamental assumption that a potato exists is false. The next logical step would be to **pick up the key** (if it will be needed) or **search for a potato** elsewhere, but without a potato in the environment the original goal cannot be satisfied.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
We have confirmed that a potato is not currently visible at any known location (table, floor, near the key). However the environment may contain unseen areas or objects that have not been inspected yet. Since the goal “place a potato on the table” fundamentally requires a potato, the next logical action is to continue searching the room (e.g., move to other coordinates, look around) to see if a potato exists somewhere else.

**Decision:** The plan step “locate the potato in the room” is still **promising**—we simply need to explore further before we can pick it up and place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the step is not completed.

**Reasoning:** The current state shows that after moving to the door there is still no potato visible anywhere in the room. The plan’s focus – to locate a potato – has not been satisfied; we have only moved around and confirmed the absence of a visible potato so far. Further exploration or discovery is required before the “locate the potato” step can be considered done.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the step is not completed.

**Reasoning:** The current state shows that after moving to the door there is still no potato visible anywhere in the room. The plan’s focus – to locate a potato – has not been satisfied; we have only moved around and confirmed the absence of a visible potato so far. Further exploration or discovery is required before the “locate the potato” step can be considered done.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

- **Agent location:** (2.0, 2.0)  
- **Inventory:** empty (no objects carried).  
- **Table (table_5):** still at (0.0, 3.0) and empty.  
- **Key (key_4):** still on the floor at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Door (door_6):** still at (4.0, 4.0), closed and unlocked.  
- **Potato:** no potato visible anywhere in the room.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The move from (4.0, 4.0) to (2.0, 2.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at (2.0, 2.0). |
| 2️⃣ | Existing objects (table, key, door) remain where they were while the agent moves. | ✅ True – their positions unchanged. |
| 3️⃣ | The agent’s inventory does not change by simply moving. | ✅ True – still empty. |
| 4️⃣ | No new potato appears simply by moving. | ✅ True – still no potato in sight. |

**Summary**

The only change is the agent’s position; everything else (table, key, door, lack of a potato) remains the same. The original goal “place a potato on the table” is still unattainable until a potato can be obtained.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflection shows the agent at (2.0, 2.0) with no potato visible anywhere in the room. Since the step “Locate the potato in the room” requires actually finding a potato, and none has been seen, the step is not yet finished.

**Answer:** No – the focused plan step has not been completed.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The last action left the agent at (2.0, 2.0) and the environment still has no potato visible. Therefore the goal of locating a potato has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The room still contains no visible potato, but the only unexplored area is behind the closed door at (4.0, 4.0). Since the door is unlocked, opening it could reveal new space where a potato might be located, making the search still promising.

[reflector] **Current facts**

- **Agent location:** (2.0, 2.0)  
- **Inventory:** empty (no objects carried).  
- **Table** (0.0, 3.0) is still empty – no potato on it.  
- **Key** (3.0, 1.0) remains on the floor at its original spot.  
- **Door** (4.0, 4.0) is still closed and unlocked.  
- **Potato:** no potato is visible anywhere in the room.

**Assumptions made before the last move (to (2.0, 2.0))**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1 | The move from (4.0, 4.0) to (2.0, 2.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at (2.0, 2.0). |
| 2 | Existing objects (table, key, door) stay where they are while the agent moves. | ✅ True – their positions are unchanged. |
| 3 | The agent’s inventory does not change by simply moving. | ✅ True – still empty. |
| 4 | No new potato appears simply by moving. | ✅ True – still no potato in sight. |

**Summary**

All assumptions about movement and object persistence were correct. The only remaining obstacle to the original goal (“place a potato on the table”) is the lack of a potato in the environment. To achieve the goal we must first locate or obtain a potato.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No – the “locate the potato” step is not finished.**  
The current state still shows no potato visible anywhere in the room, and we have not discovered or picked up a potato. Therefore the plan to locate it remains incomplete.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No – the “locate the potato” step is not finished.**  
The current state still shows no potato visible anywhere in the room, and we have not discovered or picked up a potato. Therefore the plan to locate it remains incomplete.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step 'Locate the potato in the room' is not completed because the current state still shows no potato visible anywhere and no evidence that the potato has been found.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
All observations so far show only a table, a door and a key—no potato is visible anywhere in the current area. That doesn’t prove a potato doesn’t exist; it may be hidden behind the closed door or in some other part of the room we haven’t inspected yet. To satisfy the goal we first need to find a potato, so the “locate the potato” step is still the only sensible way forward, but it will require further exploration (e.g., opening the door or moving to other unseen locations).

**Decision:** The plan to locate the potato is still promising and should be pursued by exploring the environment further.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The move from (2.0, 2.0) to (3.0, 1.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 2️⃣ | The key will stay where it is while the agent moves away. | ✅ True – the key remains at (3.0, 1.0). |

**Summary**

The only change was the agent’s position (now on the key). All other objects and the lack of a potato remain unchanged. The original goal “place a potato on the table” is still unattainable until a potato can be obtained. The next logical step would be to **pick up the key** (if it may be needed later) or **search for a potato** elsewhere.

Reasoning: The last action only moved the agent to the key’s location; the environment still shows no potato anywhere. Since the plan step **“Locate the potato in the room.”** has not been achieved, the step is **not completed**.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The agent has only moved to the key's location, and the environment still shows no potato visible anywhere. Therefore the plan step to locate a potato has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The potato has not been found yet, but the room still contains unexplored space—specifically behind the closed, unlocked door. Opening the door (and possibly moving through it) could reveal new areas where a potato might be located, so the plan to locate a potato remains viable.

**Next minimal action:** open the door at (4.0, 4.0).

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The agent has only moved to the key's location, and the environment still shows no potato visible anywhere. Therefore the plan step to locate a potato has not been achieved.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: The potato has not been found yet, but the room still contains unexplored space—specifically behind the closed, unlocked door. Opening the door (and possibly moving through it) could reveal new areas where a potato might be located, so the plan to locate a potato remains viable.

**Next minimal action:** open the door at (4.0, 4.0).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Result |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | The move from (3.0, 1.0) to the table’s location (0.0, 3.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at the table. |
| 2️⃣ | The key will stay where it is while the agent moves away. | ✅ True – the key is still at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 3️⃣ | The table is reachable and close enough to place an object on it. | ✅ True – the agent is now standing at the table. |
| 4️⃣ | A potato exists somewhere in the room that can later be placed on the table. | ❌ False – no potato is present or known. |

**Summary**  
The only change caused by the last action is the agent’s position (now at the table). All objects (key, door, table) remain where they were, and the environment still lacks a potato. The original goal “place a potato on the table” remains unattainable until a potato can be obtained. The next logical step would be to **search for a potato** or **obtain one** (e.g., by creating, bringing, or discovering it).

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The agent is standing at the table and the environment still contains no visible potato. Since the goal “Locate the potato in the room” has not been achieved (the potato has not been found or identified), the focused plan step is **not completed**.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The agent has not found any potato; no potato is visible in the environment, so the step to locate the potato is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The current goal cannot be satisfied because there is no potato in the visible area.
- The only other reachable space is behind the closed, unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0).
- Opening the door and moving through it is the minimal way to explore additional rooms where a potato might exist.

**Next action (most promising)**  
`open door_6` (the door at (4.0, 4.0)).

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The agent has not found any potato; no potato is visible in the environment, so the step to locate the potato is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The current goal cannot be satisfied because there is no potato in the visible area.
- The only other reachable space is behind the closed, unlocked door at (4.0, 4.0).
- Opening the door and moving through it is the minimal way to explore additional rooms where a potato might exist.

**Next action (most promising)**  
`open door_6` (the door at (4.0, 4.0)).
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Facts after the last action (move (0.0, 3.0) → (4.0, 4.0))**

- **Agent location:** (4.0, 4.0) – standing in front of the closed, unlocked door `door_6`.  
- **Inventory:** empty (no objects carried).  
- **Table `table_5`:** still at (0.0, 3.0) and remains empty (no potato on it).  
- **Key `key_4`:** still on the floor at (3.0, 1.0).  
- **Door `door_6`:** closed and unlocked; its state has not changed.  
- **Potato:** no potato is visible anywhere in the room.

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | The move from (0.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 4.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at (4.0, 4.0). |
| 2 | Existing objects (table, key, door) stay where they are while the agent moves. | ✅ True – all objects remained unchanged. |
| 3 | The door’s state does not change merely by moving to its location. | ✅ True – the door is still closed and unlocked. |
| 4 | A potato exists somewhere to be placed on the table. | ❌ False – no potato is present or known. |

**Summary**

The only change caused by the last action is the agent’s position. All other objects and the lack of a potato remain the same, so the original goal “place a potato on the table” is still unattainable until a potato can be obtained.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan step **“locate the potato in the room”** is **not completed**.  
Current facts show that no potato is visible anywhere, and the agent has not discovered or identified any potato position. Therefore the goal of locating a potato has not been achieved yet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The plan step **“locate the potato in the room”** is **not completed**.  
Current facts show that no potato is visible anywhere, and the agent has not discovered or identified any potato position. Therefore the goal of locating a potato has not been achieved yet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The agent has not found any potato; the environment still reports no potato visible, so the step to locate a potato is not completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:** All observed locations (table, door, key) have been visited and no potato has ever appeared. The environment contains no hidden areas or unexplored objects that could turn out to be a potato, and no mechanism to generate one has been provided. Continuing to “locate the potato” will never succeed under the current conditions.

**Conclusion:** The plan is not promising; the goal cannot be achieved without first introducing a potato into the room.

*The system reports:* “moved from (4.0,4.0) to (4,4)”. The coordinates are identical, so the agent’s position did not change.

### Facts after the action
| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 4.0) – still standing in front of the closed, unlocked door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | empty. |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), still empty (no potato). |
| **Key `key_4`** | on the floor at (3.0, 1.0). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0), closed and unlocked. |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere in the room. |

No objects were created, moved, or removed.

---

### Assumptions made before the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | *The move action is possible* (no obstacle at (4.0, 4.0)). | ✅ True – the action executed without error. |
| 2️⃣ *The agent would change position* (i.e., end up at a different tile). | ❌ False – the target tile is the same as the current one, so the position stayed the same. |
| 3️⃣ *The door’s state would remain unchanged by merely moving to it.* | ✅ True – the door is still closed and unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ *The key would stay where it is while the agent moves.* | ✅ True – the key remains at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 5️⃣ *A potato exists somewhere to be placed on the table.* | ❌ False – no potato is present in the environment. |

---

### Short reflection
The move action succeeded (it was allowed), but because the start and target coordinates are identical, the only real effect was a “no‑op”: the agent’s location, inventory, and all world objects stayed exactly as they were. All movement‑related assumptions held except the implicit one that the action would relocate the agent. The fundamental obstacle to the original goal—*the absence of a potato*—remains unchanged. The next useful step would be to acquire a potato (e.g., locate, create, or import one) before attempting to place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The reflection shows the agent executed a `move (4.0, 4.0)` command and remains at (4.0, 4.0). Since the goal of that plan step was simply to be at the closed door’s location, the step is considered done.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan step is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The reflection shows the agent executed a `move (4.0, 4.0)` command and remains at (4.0, 4.0). Since the goal of that plan step was simply to be at the closed door’s location, the step is considered done.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan step is completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The goal “place a potato on the table” has **not** been achieved.  

- The table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
- No potato is present anywhere in the room, and none has been added to the agent’s inventory.  

Since the required object (a potato) does not exist and the table remains vacant, the goal remains unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The goal “place a potato on the table” has **not** been achieved.  

- The table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
- No potato is present anywhere in the room, and none has been added to the agent’s inventory.  

Since the required object (a potato) does not exist and the table remains vacant, the goal remains unmet.

## 2️⃣  Action‑level plan (ordered)

### **Step 0 – Prepare the environment (optional but cheap)**
1. `move(3.0, 1.0)` → Pick up the key (may be needed later).  
   - `pick_up(key_4)` (now key in inventory).  

> *If the key is never needed you can skip this step; it costs only two actions.*

### **Step 1 – Open/Pass the door to explore the area beyond**
2. `move(4.0, 4.0)` → stand in front of `door_6`.  
3. `open(door_6)` (door is unlocked, so no key required).  
4. `move(4.5, 4.5)` *or any coordinate just past the door* – this represents “going through” the opened doorway.  

*Assumption:* Beyond the door there is at least one tile that can contain objects; the world generator typically places a “potato” in the room behind a door when the initial room lacks one.

### **Step 2 – Search for a potato in the new area**
5. **Loop over a small grid** (e.g., the 3×3 tiles surrounding the doorway)  

   ```
   for each target in [(4.5,4.5), (5.0,4.5), (4.5,5.0), (5.0,5.0)]:
       move(target)
       if perception contains a potato:
           goto Step 3
   ```

   *If after the loop no potato is perceived, the plan aborts with failure – the world simply does not contain a potato.*

### **Step 3 – Acquire the potato**
6. `pick_up(potato)` (the potato must be on the same tile).  
   - Inventory now: {potato} (key may still be present if you kept it).

### **Step 4 – Return to the table**
7. `move(0.0, 3.0)` → stand on `table_5`.  

### **Step 5 – Place the potato on the table**
8. `put_on(potato, table_5)`  

   - World state: `table_5` contains the potato.  
   - Goal achieved.

## 3️⃣  Conditional / fallback branches  

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| **No potato found after exploring the area beyond the door** | – Try the opposite side of the door (e.g., move to (3.5, 4.5) and scan), <br> – If still none, **fail** – the environment simply does not provide a potato, and the goal is unattainable without external input. |
| **Door cannot be opened (unexpected lock)** | Use the key: `unlock(door_6, key_4)` then `open(door_6)`. |
| **Potato appears but is already on the table** | Goal already satisfied; skip Steps 3‑5. |
| **Potato is carried but the table is blocked** | Move around obstacles (any tile not occupied) until you reach (0.0, 3.0). |

## 4️⃣  Summary of the minimal successful sequence (if the potato is indeed behind the door)

```
move(4.0,4.0)          # stand at door
open(door_6)           # door opens
move(4.5,4.5)          # step through
<search loop>          # locate the potato
pick_up(potato)        # acquire it
move(0.0,3.0)          # go to the table
put_on(potato, table_5)# place it
```

If you decide to keep the key for future puzzles, prepend the optional key‑pickup actions before step 1.

### Current facts  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 4.0) – still in front of the closed, unlocked door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | empty. |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0); contains no potato. |
| **Key `key_4`** | on the floor at (3.0, 1.0). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0); closed, unlocked. |
| **Potato** | not present anywhere in the room. |

No objects were created, moved, or removed.

---

### Assumptions made before the action  

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The move action is possible (no obstacle). | ✅ True – the action executed without error. |
| 2️⃣ | The agent would end up at a *different* tile. | ❌ False – start and target coordinates are identical, so the position stayed the same. |
| 3️⃣ | The door’s state would not change simply by moving to it. | ✅ True – the door remains closed and unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | The key would stay where it is while the agent moves. | ✅ True – key remains at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 5️⃣ | A potato exists somewhere to be placed later. | ❌ False – no potato is visible in the environment. |

---

### Short reflection  

The only effect of the action was a *no‑op*: the agent’s location did not change. All movement‑related assumptions held except the implicit one that the move would relocate the agent. The key, door, and table stayed unchanged, and the fundamental obstacle to the goal—*the missing potato*—remains. The next useful step is to obtain a potato (e.g., locate, create, or import one) before trying to place it on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action was `move(4.0,4.0)`.  
The reflection shows the agent is already at (4.0, 4.0) in front of the closed, unlocked door, and the action succeeded (even though it was a no‑op). Therefore the intended step “stand at the door” has been achieved.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan step is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last action was `move(4.0,4.0)`.  
The reflection shows the agent is already at (4.0, 4.0) in front of the closed, unlocked door, and the action succeeded (even though it was a no‑op). Therefore the intended step “stand at the door” has been achieved.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan step is completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The reflection shows that nothing has changed except the agent’s position; the table is still empty and no potato exists in the room. Since the goal **“place a potato on the table”** requires a potato to be on the table, and that condition is not satisfied, the initial main goal has **not** been reached.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The reflection shows that nothing has changed except the agent’s position; the table is still empty and no potato exists in the room. Since the goal **“place a potato on the table”** requires a potato to be on the table, and that condition is not satisfied, the initial main goal has **not** been reached.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** Place a potato on `table_5` (at (0.0, 3.0))

---

## 1️⃣  Diagnose the missing ingredient  

| Observation | Result |
|------------|--------|
| No potato is visible anywhere in the current room. | We must **obtain** a potato before we can place it. |
| The only exit we see is the closed, unlocked door `door_6` at (4.0, 4.0). | The area behind the door may contain a potato (or a way to get one). |
| A key `key_4` sits on the floor at (3.0, 1.0). | The key may be useful later (e.g., to open other doors), but it is **not required** to open the already‑unlocked door.  It is cheap to pick it up now in case we need it later. |

**Conclusion:** First reach the area behind `door_6`; search there for a potato; if none is found, explore the rest of the map systematically.

## 3️⃣  Detailed action sequence (ready to be issued to the engine)

| # | Action | Preconditions | Effect / Reason |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `move(3.0,1.0)` | Agent at (4.0,4.0) → path free | Stand on the key. |
| 2 | `pickup(key_4)` | Agent on key_4, inventory empty | Key is now in inventory (may be useful later). |
| 3 | `move(4.0,4.0)` | Agent at (3.0,1.0) → path free | Return to the door. |
| 4 | `open(door_6)` | Door is closed **and** unlocked, agent adjacent | Door becomes **open** (no longer blocks movement). |
| 5 | `move(5.0,4.0)` | Tile (5.0,4.0) is passable (assumed free) | Step into the room beyond the door. |
| 6‑∞| **Exploration loop** (repeat until a potato is discovered) | – | `move` to an adjacent unexplored tile, `look`/`sense` for a potato. |
| X | `pickup(potato)` | Agent on tile that contains a potato, inventory empty | Potato added to inventory. |
| Y | `move(0.0,3.0)` | Path from current location back to the table is clear | Reach the table. |
| Z | `puton(potato, table_5)` | Potato in inventory, agent adjacent to table_5 | Potato now rests on the table → **goal achieved**. |

*If the exploration loop finishes **without** finding a potato, the plan should backtrack and try a different set of reachable tiles (e.g., go around the map, try opening other doors if any appear later).  The loop can be implemented as a simple breadth‑first search that records visited coordinates.*

---

## 4️⃣  Contingency handling

1. **No potato beyond `door_6`** – Continue exploring all reachable tiles (including any other doors that become visible).  
2. **Encounter a locked door** – If a door is **locked**, first check the inventory for a key; if we have one, `unlock(door)` then `open(door)`.  
3. **Run out of movement space** – If the environment is fully explored and still no potato, the mission is impossible with the current world state; the planner must report failure.  

---

## 5️⃣  Execution notes for the environment

* The engine generally supports the following primitive actions (all of which are used above):  

| Primitive | Syntax example | What it does |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| `move(x,y)` | `move(3.0,1.0)` | Walks to the given integer‑grid coordinate if unobstructed. |
| `pickup(obj)` | `pickup(key_4)` | Takes the object from the floor into the inventory. |
| `open(door)` | `open(door_6)` | Opens a closed, **unlocked** door. |
| `unlock(door)` | `unlock(door_7)` | Uses a key from inventory to unlock a locked door. |
| `puton(item, target)` | `puton(potato, table_5)` | Places an inventory item onto a surface. |
| `look` / `sense` | implicit on each move – the engine reveals objects on the tile. |

*All actions are atomic; the planner must wait for the engine’s acknowledgement before issuing the next one.*

---

## 6️⃣  Summary  

1. **Pick up the key** (cheap, may be needed later).  
2. **Open the only visible exit** (`door_6`) and step through.  
3. **Explore the new area** until a potato is discovered.  
4. **Pick up the potato**, return to the table, and **put it on the table**.  

Following the ordered action list above will either satisfy the goal *“place a potato on the table”* or exhaust the reachable space, at which point the planner can report that the goal is unattainable with the current world configuration.

[reflector] **New facts after the last action**  

- **Agent location:** (3.0, 1.0) – standing on the tile where **key_4** lies.

**Assumptions made before the move and their outcome**

| # | Assumption | Result |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | The move from (4.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 1.0) is possible (no obstacles). | ✅ True – the agent arrived at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 2️⃣ | Existing objects (table, key, door) remain where they were while the agent moves. | ✅ True – the key is still at (3.0, 1.0), the table and door unchanged. |
| 3️⃣ | The agent’s inventory does not change simply by moving. | ✅ True – inventory is still empty. |
| 4️⃣ | No new potato appears simply by moving. | ✅ True – still no potato in the environment. |
| 5️⃣ | The key can be picked up now that the agent stands on it (pre‑condition satisfied). | ✅ Holds – the key is reachable, though it has not yet been taken. |

All assumptions were confirmed; the only change is the agent’s position, putting the key within immediate reach. The original goal (“place a potato on the table”) remains impossible until a potato can be obtained. The next sensible step is to **pick up the key** or **search for a potato**.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action moved the agent from (4.0, 4.0) → (3.0, 1.0).  
Current facts show the agent is now at (3.0, 1.0), standing on the tile where **key_4** lies.  

**Therefore the plan step “A1: move to (3.0, 1.0) to reach the key” is completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last action moved the agent from (4.0, 4.0) → (3.0, 1.0).  
Current facts show the agent is now at (3.0, 1.0), standing on the tile where **key_4** lies.  

**Therefore the plan step “A1: move to (3.0, 1.0) to reach the key” is completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the goal is not reached.

**Reasoning:**  
- The table `table_5` (at 0.0, 3.0) is still empty; no potato is on it.  
- The environment contains no potato at all, and the agent’s inventory is empty.  
- The only change from the previous step is that the agent moved to the key’s location; the key has not been picked up and no potato has been obtained.  

Therefore the condition “place a potato on the table” is still unsatisfied.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the goal is not reached.

**Reasoning:**  
- The table `table_5` (at 0.0, 3.0) is still empty; no potato is on it.  
- The environment contains no potato at all, and the agent’s inventory is empty.  
- The only change from the previous step is that the agent moved to the key’s location; the key has not been picked up and no potato has been obtained.  

Therefore the condition “place a potato on the table” is still unsatisfied.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[plan_imaginator] **Plan – “Place a potato on the table”**  
*Current state (after the last successful move):*  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (3.0, 1.0) – standing on the tile that contains **key_4** |
| **Inventory** | empty |
| **key_4** | on the floor at (3.0, 1.0) |
| **table_5** | at (0.0, 3.0) – empty |
| **door_6** | at (4.0, 4.0) – closed, unlocked |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere in the room |

The only obstacle to the goal is the **absence of a potato**.  
The only way we can obtain a potato is to **explore beyond the closed door** (the door leads to another room that is not yet visible). The door is unlocked, but we need a key to open it.

---

## 1. High‑level sub‑goals  

| # | Sub‑goal | Reason |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Acquire the key** | Needed to open the door. |
| 2 | **Open the door** | Allows us to leave the current room and reach the area where a potato may be located. |
| 3 | **Enter the adjacent room** | Position us inside the space that may contain a potato. |
| 4 | **Locate & pick up a potato** | The only object that can be placed on the table. |
| 5 | **Return to the table** | Bring the potato back to **table_5**. |
| 6 | **Place the potato on the table** | Satisfies the original goal. |

---

## 2. Detailed step‑by‑step plan  

### 1️⃣ Acquire the key  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `pick_up(key_4)` | Agent at (3.0, 1.0) **and** key_4 is on the floor at (3.0, 1.0) | key_4 removed from floor, added to inventory |

*Result*: Inventory = {key_4}. Location unchanged.

---

### 2️⃣ Open the door  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `open(door_6)` | Agent is adjacent to the door (any tile that shares a side with (4.0, 4.0)), door_6 is *closed* and *unlocked*, key_4 is in inventory (or the door does not require a key because it is unlocked) | door_6 state changes to *open* (still at (4.0, 4.0)) |

*Implementation note*: The simplest adjacent tile is (4.0, 3.0) or (3.0, 4.0). We will move to one of them first.

---

### 3️⃣ Move to an adjacent tile and open the door  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(4.0, 3.0)` | Agent at (3.0, 1.0) – path (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (4,3) is free | Agent location becomes (4.0, 3.0) |
| `open(door_6)` | Agent at (4.0, 3.0) (adjacent to door), door closed & unlocked, key in inventory | door_6 → **open** |

---

### 4️⃣ Enter the adjacent room (through the opened door)  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(5.0, 4.0)` *(or any tile directly beyond the door)* | Door_6 is **open**, agent at (4.0, 4.0) or (4.0, 3.0) and the tile (5,4) is free | Agent location becomes (5.0, 4.0) – now inside the unknown room |

*If the map defines the “other side” of the door as (5, 4), use that coordinate; otherwise pick the first free tile that lies beyond the door.*

---

### 5️⃣ Search for a potato in the new room  

Because the layout of the new room is unknown, we perform a systematic exploration until a potato is observed.

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `explore()` | Agent inside the new room, inventory may contain the key, door_6 is open | The system reveals any objects on the explored tiles. If a **potato** appears, its location is added to the world model. The exploration continues until a potato is found or the whole reachable area has been visited. |

*Implementation suggestion*:  
- Walk a short step in each cardinal direction (`move`) and backtrack, marking visited tiles.  
- Stop as soon as a tile containing an object with type *potato* is observed.

---

#### 5a. If a potato is found (e.g., at (7.0, 5.0))

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(7.0, 5.0)` | Potato is located at (7.0, 5.0) and the path is clear | Agent at (7.0, 5.0) |
| `pick_up(potato)` | Agent at (7.0, 5.0) and potato is on the floor | Potato removed from floor, added to inventory |

*If multiple potatoes exist, pick the first one encountered.*

---

#### 5b. If **no potato** is found after exhaustive exploration  

- **Fail** the overall plan (the goal is impossible with the current world configuration).  
- Optionally, report “No potato discovered – cannot achieve goal”.

---

### 6️⃣ Return to the table  

Assuming the potato is now in the inventory:

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move_back_to_table` | Agent in the other room, knows a path back to (0.0, 3.0) (the table’s location) | Agent travels through the open door, reaches (0.0, 3.0) – standing at the table |

*The path can be the reverse of the one used to enter: (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → … → (0,3).*

---

### 7️⃣ Place the potato on the table  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `place(potato, table_5)` | Agent at (0.0, 3.0) (the table’s location), potato is in inventory, table_5 is empty | Potato removed from inventory, becomes a child of **table_5** (i.e., “on the table”) |

**Goal achieved** – the world now contains a potato on **table_5**.

---

## 3. Contingency / Failure handling  

| Situation | How to respond |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Key cannot be picked up** (e.g., another agent holds it) | Abort – you cannot open the door, thus cannot reach a potato. Report failure. |
| **Door cannot be opened** (locked or broken) | Abort – no access to the other room. Report failure. |
| **Exploration yields no potato** | Abort – the goal is unattainable with the given environment. Report failure. |
| **Potato is found but cannot be carried** (too heavy) | Abort – cannot satisfy the final sub‑goal. Report failure. |

---

## 4. Summary of the full plan (in ordered pseudo‑code)

```
# 1. Get the key
pick_up(key_4)

# 2. Move next to the door and open it
move(4.0, 3.0)
open(door_6)

# 3. Walk through the now‑open door
move(5.0, 4.0)          # enter the adjacent room

# 4. Systematically explore the new room
while not explored_all_tiles:
    move(to_next_unvisited_tile)
    if see(potato):
        break

# 5. If a potato was discovered, pick it up
if potato_found:
    move(potato_position)
    pick_up(potato)
else:
    FAIL("No potato in the reachable area")

# 6. Return to the table
follow_path_back_to(0.0, 3.0)   # pass through the door

# 7. Place the potato on the table
place(potato, table_5)

# Goal achieved
```

Execute the actions in the order shown, checking the pre‑conditions before each step. If any pre‑condition fails, follow the contingency rules above. When the final `place` action succeeds, the goal *“place a potato on the table”* is satisfied.

| **table_5** | at (0.0, 3.0) – empty |
| **door_6** | at (4.0, 4.0) – closed, unlocked |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere in the room |

The only obstacle to the goal is the **absence of a potato**.  
The only way we can obtain a potato is to **explore beyond the closed door** (the door leads to another room that is not yet visible). The door is unlocked, but we need a key to open it.

| `pick_up(key_4)` | Agent at (3.0, 1.0) **and** key_4 is on the floor at (3.0, 1.0) | key_4 removed from floor, added to inventory |

*Result*: Inventory = {key_4}. Location unchanged.

---

### 2️⃣ Open the door  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `open(door_6)` | Agent is adjacent to the door (any tile that shares a side with (4.0, 4.0)), door_6 is *closed* and *unlocked*, key_4 is in inventory (or the door does not require a key because it is unlocked) | door_6 state changes to *open* (still at (4.0, 4.0)) |

*Implementation note*: The simplest adjacent tile is (4.0, 3.0) or (3.0, 4.0). We will move to one of them first.

---

### 3️⃣ Move to an adjacent tile and open the door  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(4.0, 3.0)` | Agent at (3.0, 1.0) – path (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (4,3) is free | Agent location becomes (4.0, 3.0) |
| `open(door_6)` | Agent at (4.0, 3.0) (adjacent to door), door closed & unlocked, key in inventory | door_6 → **open** |

---

### 4️⃣ Enter the adjacent room (through the opened door)  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(5.0, 4.0)` *(or any tile directly beyond the door)* | Door_6 is **open**, agent at (4.0, 4.0) or (4.0, 3.0) and the tile (5,4) is free | Agent location becomes (5.0, 4.0) – now inside the unknown room |

*If the map defines the “other side” of the door as (5, 4), use that coordinate; otherwise pick the first free tile that lies beyond the door.*

---

### 5️⃣ Search for a potato in the new room  

Because the layout of the new room is unknown, we perform a systematic exploration until a potato is observed.

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `explore()` | Agent inside the new room, inventory may contain the key, door_6 is open | The system reveals any objects on the explored tiles. If a **potato** appears, its location is added to the world model. The exploration continues until a potato is found or the whole reachable area has been visited. |

*Implementation suggestion*:  
- Walk a short step in each cardinal direction (`move`) and backtrack, marking visited tiles.  
- Stop as soon as a tile containing an object with type *potato* is observed.

---

#### 5a. If a potato is found (e.g., at (7.0, 5.0))

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move(7.0, 5.0)` | Potato is located at (7.0, 5.0) and the path is clear | Agent at (7.0, 5.0) |
| `pick_up(potato)` | Agent at (7.0, 5.0) and potato is on the floor | Potato removed from floor, added to inventory |

*If multiple potatoes exist, pick the first one encountered.*

---

#### 5b. If **no potato** is found after exhaustive exploration  

- **Fail** the overall plan (the goal is impossible with the current world configuration).  
- Optionally, report “No potato discovered – cannot achieve goal”.

---

### 6️⃣ Return to the table  

Assuming the potato is now in the inventory:

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `move_back_to_table` | Agent in the other room, knows a path back to (0.0, 3.0) (the table’s location) | Agent travels through the open door, reaches (0.0, 3.0) – standing at the table |

*The path can be the reverse of the one used to enter: (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → … → (0,3).*

---

### 7️⃣ Place the potato on the table  

| Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `place(potato, table_5)` | Agent at (0.0, 3.0) (the table’s location), potato is in inventory, table_5 is empty | Potato removed from inventory, becomes a child of **table_5** (i.e., “on the table”) |

**Goal achieved** – the world now contains a potato on **table_5**.

---

## 3. Contingency / Failure handling  

| Situation | How to respond |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Key cannot be picked up** (e.g., another agent holds it) | Abort – you cannot open the door, thus cannot reach a potato. Report failure. |
| **Door cannot be opened** (locked or broken) | Abort – no access to the other room. Report failure. |
| **Exploration yields no potato** | Abort – the goal is unattainable with the given environment. Report failure. |
| **Potato is found but cannot be carried** (too heavy) | Abort – cannot satisfy the final sub‑goal. Report failure. |

---

## 4. Summary of the full plan (in ordered pseudo‑code)

```
# 1. Get the key
pick_up(key_4)

# 2. Move next to the door and open it
move(4.0, 3.0)
open(door_6)

# 3. Walk through the now‑open door
move(5.0, 4.0)          # enter the adjacent room

# 4. Systematically explore the new room
while not explored_all_tiles:
    move(to_next_unvisited_tile)
    if see(potato):
        break

# 5. If a potato was discovered, pick it up
if potato_found:
    move(potato_position)
    pick_up(potato)
else:
    FAIL("No potato in the reachable area")

# 6. Return to the table
follow_path_back_to(0.0, 3.0)   # pass through the door

# 7. Place the potato on the table
place(potato, table_5)

# Goal achieved
```

Execute the actions in the order shown, checking the pre‑conditions before each step. If any pre‑condition fails, follow the contingency rules above. When the final `place` action succeeds, the goal *“place a potato on the table”* is satisfied.
Use toolcalls to add the steps specified in the plan for the user.

[observer] **Observations**

- I am at position (3.0, 1.0).  
- The key **key_4** is exactly at this location.  
- My inventory is still empty.  
- Table table_5 at (0.0, 3.0) remains empty, and door door_6 at (4.0, 4.0) is closed‑unlocked.  
- No potato is visible anywhere in the room.  

These facts confirm that the precondition for **pick_up(key_4)** (standing on the key) is satisfied.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **New facts after the action `pick_up(key_4)`**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (3.0, 1.0) – unchanged |
| **Inventory** | now contains **key_4** (previously empty) |
| **Key key_4** | no longer on the floor; it is being carried |
| **Table table_5** | at (0.0, 3.0), still empty |
| **Door door_6** | at (4.0, 4.0), closed and unlocked |
| **Potato** | not visible anywhere in the room |

**Assumptions made before the pick‑up**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | The agent is standing on the key, satisfying the pre‑condition. | ✅ True – the agent was at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 2️⃣ | `pick_up(key_4)` will transfer the key from the floor to the inventory. | ✅ True – key is now in inventory. |
| 3️⃣ | The key will be removed from the world location after being taken. | ✅ True – the floor tile at (3.0, 1.0) is now empty. |
| 4️⃣ | No other objects (table, door, potato) are affected by the pick‑up. | ✅ True – they remain unchanged. |
| 5️⃣ | The action will succeed without error (the key is reachable and not already held). | ✅ True – the system reported “collected key_4”. |

All assumptions turned out to be correct; the only change in the world state is that **key_4** is now held by the agent and no longer resides on the floor. The fundamental problem (absence of a potato) is unchanged. The next useful step is to obtain a potato before attempting to place anything on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes – the focused step is finished.  
The reflection shows that after executing `pick_up(key_4)` the key is now in the agent’s inventory and no longer on the floor, confirming the action succeeded and the plan step is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: Yes – the focused step is finished.  
The reflection shows that after executing `pick_up(key_4)` the key is now in the agent’s inventory and no longer on the floor, confirming the action succeeded and the plan step is completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No, the goal has not been reached.**  

- The table `table_5` is still empty.  
- There is no potato anywhere in the room.  
- The only change so far is that you now hold `key_4`, which does not contribute to placing a potato.  

Thus the condition “a potato is on the table” is still unsatisfied.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: **No, the goal has not been reached.**  

- The table `table_5` is still empty.  
- There is no potato anywhere in the room.  
- The only change so far is that you now hold `key_4`, which does not contribute to placing a potato.  

Thus the condition “a potato is on the table” is still unsatisfied.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Initial main goal is not yet reached
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5` (located at (0.0, 3.0)).*  

**Current state**  

| Entity | Location | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Agent | (3.0, 1.0) | holding **key_4** |
| `key_4` | – | in inventory |
| `table_5` | (0.0, 3.0) | empty |
| `door_6` | (4.0, 4.0) | **closed**, **unlocked** |
| Potato | ? | **not visible** anywhere in the known area |

Because a potato is not present in the part of the room we have already inspected, the most plausible way to obtain one is to **explore the space behind `door_6`** (the only unexplored passage).  
The plan is therefore decomposed into three high‑level sub‑goals:

1. **Gain access to the area behind the door.**  
2. **Locate and acquire a potato.**  
3. **Bring the potato to the table and put it down.**  

Below is a **deterministic, step‑by‑step plan** that satisfies the pre‑conditions of each action.  Wherever a choice is required (e.g., where the potato might be), the plan includes a small *search loop* that can be repeated until the potato is found.

---

## 1️⃣  Gain access to the area behind the door  

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1.1 | `move(4.0, 4.0)` | Agent at (3.0, 1.0); path to (4.0, 4.0) is free | Agent now stands on the closed door tile |
| 1.2 | `open(door_6)` | Agent on door_6; door_6 is **closed** and **unlocked** | `door_6.state = open` |
| 1.3 | `move(5.0, 4.0)` *(or any tile just beyond the door that is known to be free)* | Door is open; tile (5.0, 4.0) is traversable | Agent is now inside the **unexplored room** behind the door |

*Assumption:* The map contains at least one free tile on the far side of `door_6` (we use (5.0, 4.0) as a representative coordinate). The action `open` works on unlocked doors without needing the key; the key we carry may be required later, but it does **not** block opening.

---

## 2️⃣  Locate and acquire a potato  

The unexplored room is small (a 3 × 3‑tile patch centred on (5, 4)).  We will systematically scan it.  If a potato exists it will be discovered; if not, the plan will terminate with failure (the higher‑level system can decide on an alternative strategy, e.g., “request a potato” or “reset”).  

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 2.1 | `search(5.0, 4.0)` | Agent at (5.0, 4.0) | Reveals any objects on the current tile (none at start) |
| 2.2 | `move(5.0, 5.0)` | Tile (5.0, 5.0) reachable | Agent moves north |
| 2.3 | `search(5.0, 5.0)` | — | If a potato (`potato_1`) is on this tile, it becomes **visible** |
| 2.4 | `move(6.0, 5.0)` | — | Agent moves east |
| 2.5 | `search(6.0, 5.0)` | — | … |
| 2.6 | `move(6.0, 4.0)` | — | Agent moves south |
| 2.7 | `search(6.0, 4.0)` | — | … |
| 2.8 | `move(6.0, 3.0)` | — | Agent moves south |
| 2.9 | `search(6.0, 3.0)` | — | … |
| 2.10| `move(5.0, 3.0)` | — | Agent moves west |
| 2.11| `search(5.0, 3.0)` | — | … |
| 2.12| `move(4.0, 3.0)` | — | Agent moves west (last tile of the room) |
| 2.13| `search(4.0, 3.0)` | — | … |

**If at any `search` step a potato object (e.g., `potato_1`) appears**, immediately execute:

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 2.X | `pick_up(potato_1)` | Agent standing on tile containing `potato_1`; inventory has free slot | `potato_1` moves from world location to agent’s inventory; the tile becomes empty |

If the whole scan finishes without discovering a potato, the plan **fails** at this point (the system must provide a potato by some external means before proceeding).

---

## 3️⃣  Bring the potato to the table and place it  

Assuming the potato is now in the inventory:

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Effects |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 3.1 | `move(4.0, 4.0)` | Agent at (5.0, 4.0) (or wherever the potato was picked up); door_6 is open | Agent stands on the door tile |
| 3.2 | `close(door_6)` *(optional – not required for the goal but keeps the world tidy)* | Door is open | `door_6.state = closed` |
| 3.3 | `move(3.0, 1.0)` | Path back to the original zone is clear | Agent returns to the key‑room |
| 3.4 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Path to the table is clear | Agent stands on the table tile |
| 3.5 | `place(potato_1, table_5)` | Agent has `potato_1` in inventory; agent is at the same location as `table_5` | `potato_1` is removed from inventory and becomes a child of `table_5`; goal satisfied |

---

### Summary of the full plan (linearized)

```
1. move(4.0, 4.0)                # go to the door
2. open(door_6)                  # open the unlocked door

   pick_up(potato_X)

# --- Return to the table and place the potato ---
11. move(4.0, 4.0)               # back to the door
12. (optional) close(door_6)
13. move(3.0, 1.0)               # back to the key‑room
14. move(0.0, 3.0)               # stand on the table
15. place(potato_X, table_5)     # goal achieved
```

---

### What to do if the search fails

*The plan above is **complete** with respect to the information we have.*  
If the exhaustive scan of the room behind `door_6` finishes without uncovering a potato, the agent must obtain a potato by a different means (e.g., request it from the environment, spawn it, or look elsewhere).  In that case the planner should be **re‑invoked** with a new sub‑goal such as `obtain(potato)` before retrying steps 3‑15.

---

**Key points**

* The key we already carry is **not required** to open `door_6` because the door is unlocked; keeping it in the inventory does not hinder any later action.  
* All movement actions respect the world’s connectivity (no obstacles have been reported).  
* The search loop guarantees that, *if* a potato exists in the adjacent unexplored chamber, it will be found and picked up.  
* Once the potato is in the inventory, the final `place` action directly satisfies the original goal.

[user] Plan: **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5` (located at (0.0, 3.0)).*

### Assumptions made before the move (and their outcomes)

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | The tile (4.0, 4.0) is reachable – no obstacle blocks the path. | ✅ True (move succeeded). |
| 2️⃣ | The agent’s inventory stays unchanged while moving. | ✅ True (still holding `key_4`). |
| 3️⃣ | The key will remain in the inventory after the move. | ✅ True (key is still carried). |
| 4️⃣ | The door’s state does not change simply by moving to its location. | ✅ True (door is still closed & unlocked). |
| 5️⃣ | Table, key floor location, and other objects stay where they were unless acted upon. | ✅ True (table unchanged, floor no longer has the key). |
| 6️⃣ | No potato appears spontaneously because of the move. | ✅ True (potato still absent). |

All assumptions held; no contradictions were observed.

**Short reflection:**  
The only state change was the agent’s position. The key remains in inventory, the door stayed closed‑unlocked, the table is still empty, and the missing potato problem persists. The next useful step is to acquire a potato (e.g., locate, create, or bring one) before trying to place anything on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last reflected state shows the agent **at (4.0, 4.0)**, which is exactly the target of the planned step `move(4.0, 4.0)`. No further movement was required, and the action succeeded without error.  

**Conclusion:** The focused plan step `move(4.0, 4.0)` is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last reflected state shows the agent **at (4.0, 4.0)**, which is exactly the target of the planned step `move(4.0, 4.0)`. No further movement was required, and the action succeeded without error.  

**Conclusion:** The focused plan step `move(4.0, 4.0)` is completed.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The goal was to have a potato on **table_5**.  
Current state: the table is still empty, there is no potato anywhere in the room, and the agent only holds a key. Since the required object (a potato) is missing and the table has not been furnished, the goal has not been achieved.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The goal was to have a potato on **table_5**.  
Current state: the table is still empty, there is no potato anywhere in the room, and the agent only holds a key. Since the required object (a potato) is missing and the table has not been furnished, the goal has not been achieved.

**Answer:** No.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Initial main goal is not yet reached
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** Place a potato on **table_5** (at (0.0, 3.0))

**Current situation**  

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Agent location | (4.0, 4.0) – in front of the closed, unlocked **door_6** |
| Inventory | **key_4** (carried) |
| **door_6** | closed, unlocked, at (4.0, 4.0) |
| **table_5** | empty, at (0.0, 3.0) |
| **potato** | not present anywhere in the known room |
| **key_4** | no longer on the floor (now in inventory) |

The only obstacle to the goal is the **absence of a potato**.  
The environment gives us two obvious ways to obtain one:

1. **Explore the area behind the door** – the door may lead to another room that already contains a potato.  
2. **Spawn / create a potato** – if the simulation permits an explicit “create” action (many sandbox‑style environments support it).

The plan below is written in a **structured, conditional format** so that you can follow it step‑by‑step regardless of which of the two possibilities is available in your simulation.

---

## Structured Plan

### 1️⃣  Open the door (pre‑condition: door is closed & unlocked)

```
open(door_6)          // Result: door_6 becomes open
```

*If the engine does not require an explicit `open` because the door is unlocked, skip this step and go directly to 2.*

---

### 2️⃣  Move to the far side of the door

```
move(5.0, 4.0)        // any walkable tile just beyond the doorway
```

*You are now in the “next room” (or hallway) where the potato might be.*

---

### 3️⃣  Search for a potato  

| Sub‑step | Action | Success condition |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| 3‑a | `look_around()` or simply *scan the current tile* | If a potato object is detected on the floor, go to step 4. |
| 3‑b | `move` to adjacent tiles (north, south, east, west) and repeat 3‑a until the whole reachable area is examined. | If after exhaustive search no potato is found, go to step 5. |

*You may keep a list of visited coordinates to avoid infinite loops.*

---

### 4️⃣  **Potato found** – pick it up, return to the table, and place it  

```
pick_up(potato)       // pre‑condition: you are standing on the potato
move(0.0, 3.0)        // go back to the location of table_5
place(potato, table_5)   // pre‑condition: table_5 is at your position (or adjacent) and empty
```

*Goal achieved – the table now holds a potato.*

---

### 5️⃣  **No potato discovered** – create/spawn one  

| Action | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| `create(potato)` **or** `spawn(potato, (0.5, 3.5))` | If the environment supports object creation, this puts a fresh potato at a convenient spot near the table. |
| *Alternative:* `request_object(potato)` | Some systems require you to ask the “world manager” for a new item. |
| After creation, continue with step 4 (pick‑up → move → place). |

*If the simulation does **not** allow creation, you will need to obtain a potato from elsewhere (e.g., by unlocking another door, solving a puzzle, etc.). In that case, repeat steps 1‑3 for any new accessible rooms.*

---

### 6️⃣  End of plan  

- **Success**: `table_5` contains the potato.  
- **Failure**: If neither a potato can be found nor created, the plan must be extended with additional exploration (e.g., open other doors, interact with other objects) or by asking the game master for a potato.

### Assumptions made before executing `open(door_6)`

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | **The door is reachable** (no obstacle between the agent and the door). | ✅ True – the action succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | **The door can be opened while unlocked** (no lock‑picking required). | ✅ True – the door opened without needing to use the key. |
| 3️⃣ | **Having the key in inventory does not prevent opening** (the key is optional). | ✅ True – the door opened even though it was already unlocked. |
| 4️⃣ | **Opening the door does not affect other objects** (table, key, potato). | ✅ True – everything else stayed the same. |
| 5️⃣ | **The key remains in the inventory after the action** (it is not consumed). | ✅ True – the key is still held. |
| 6️⃣ | **No new potato appears simply because the door opened**. | ✅ True – the potato is still absent. |

All assumptions proved correct; there were no contradictions.

### Short reflection  

The only world‑state change caused by the last action was the **state of `door_6`** changing from *closed* to *open*. The agent still holds the key, the table remains empty, and the fundamental obstacle to the original goal—**the missing potato**—persists. The environment is now more permissive (the door is open), so subsequent steps can involve moving through the doorway, but a potato must still be obtained before it can be placed on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan’s current focus is to **open door_6** (if it isn’t already open).  
The last executed action was `open(door_6)`, and the reflection confirms that the door’s state changed from *closed* to **open** while the agent remained at (4.0, 4.0).  

Since the required state (door 6 open) has been achieved, the focused plan step is **completed**.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The plan’s current focus is to **open door_6** (if it isn’t already open).  
The last executed action was `open(door_6)`, and the reflection confirms that the door’s state changed from *closed* to **open** while the agent remained at (4.0, 4.0).  

Since the required state (door 6 open) has been achieved, the focused plan step is **completed**.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No – the goal has not been reached.**  

The current world state shows:

* The table `table_5` at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
* No potato exists anywhere in the room, and none has ever been placed on the table.  

Thus the condition “a potato is on the table” is false, so the main goal remains unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: **No – the goal has not been reached.**  

The current world state shows:

* The table `table_5` at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty.  
* No potato exists anywhere in the room, and none has ever been placed on the table.  

Thus the condition “a potato is on the table” is false, so the main goal remains unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Main goal: Place a potato on the table.
Replanning because Initial main goal is not yet reached
Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** Place a potato on **table_5** (at (0.0, 3.0))

**Current state**  

| Entity | Location / State | In inventory? |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Agent  | (4.0, 4.0) – in front of **door_6** (open, unlocked) | – |
| key_4  | carried by the agent | ✅ |
| table_5| (0.0, 3.0) – empty | – |
| potato | **not present** anywhere in the room | – |

The only missing piece is a **potato**.  
The plan therefore has two phases:

1. **Acquire a potato** (either find an existing one or create one).  
2. **Deliver the potato to the table** and put it there.

---

## Phase 1 – Acquire a potato  

| # | Action | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | `scan()` (or `look_around`) | Agent is anywhere in the room | System reports any visible objects; we will know whether a potato already exists. |
| 1.2 | **If a potato is reported** → `move(x_p, y_p)` to the potato’s coordinates | Tile (x_p, y_p) is reachable (no obstacle) | Agent stands on the potato. |
| 1.3 | **If a potato is reported** → `pick_up(potato)` | Agent is on the same tile as the potato and inventory has free slot | Potato is removed from the floor and added to inventory. |
| 1.4 | **If scan finds no potato** → `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`) | Agent is at any reachable tile; the environment allows object creation | A new potato appears on the agent’s current tile. |
| 1.5 | (after creation) → `pick_up(potato)` | Agent and potato share the same tile | Potato is now in inventory. |

*Only one of the two branches (existing‑potato vs. create‑potato) will be executed, depending on the result of step 1.1.*

---

## Phase 2 – Deliver the potato to the table  

| # | Action | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2.1 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Agent can walk to (0.0, 3.0) – tile is not blocked (door_6 is open, the path is clear) | Agent stands on the table tile. |
| 2.2 | `place(potato, table_5)` | Potato is in inventory, table_5 is at the same location and is empty | Potato is removed from inventory and becomes a contents of table_5. |
| 2.3 | `verify(table_5)` (optional) | – | System reports that table_5 now contains a potato – goal achieved. |

if (potato_found) {
    move(potato.x, potato.y)        // step 1.2
    pick_up(potato)                 // step 1.3
} else {
    create(potato)                  // step 1.4
    pick_up(potato)                 // step 1.5
}
move(0.0, 3.0)                       // step 2.1
place(potato, table_5)               // step 2.2
```

---

### Why this plan works

* **Reachability:** All target tiles (potato location, table, door) are reachable; the door is already open, so no further unlocking is required.  
* **Inventory constraints:** The agent only needs one free slot – the key already occupies a slot, but most sandbox environments allow multiple items; if not, the key can be dropped (`drop(key_4)`) before picking up the potato (add a `drop(key_4)` before step 1.2/1.4 if needed).  
* **Missing object handling:** By scanning first we avoid unnecessary creation; the fallback `create(potato)` guarantees we will always have a potato.  
* **Final placement:** `place(potato, table_5)` succeeds because the table is empty and the agent is co‑located with it.

Executing the script above will move the agent from the open door to the table, give the agent a potato (either by finding or spawning one), and finally put that potato on the table—exactly satisfying the original goal.

[observer] **Observations (verified against the latest perception)**  

- I am still at **(4.0, 4.0)**.  
- My inventory contains **key_4**.  
- **door_6** at (4.0, 4.0) is now **open** and **unlocked** (the only change from the previous state).  
- **table_5** remains at (0.0, 3.0) and is empty.  
- No potato is visible anywhere in the room.  

**Relevance** – The door’s new *open* state is the only new fact; everything else matches the prior world model. This confirms that the environment is now passable through the doorway, but the missing potato still prevents placing anything on the table.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Current facts (unchanged from the previous successful step)**  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 4.0) – still standing in front of `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | contains **key_4** (the key is still being carried). |
| **Door `door_6`** | **open** and **unlocked**. |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), empty. |
| **Key `key_4`** | not on the floor (in inventory). |
| **Potato** | not present anywhere in the room. |
| **Room layout** | otherwise unchanged. |

**Effect of the last action (`scan()`)**

- The action **failed** with the message: *“That key cannot lock this object. Hint: Use one of the keys referenced in the observation.”*  
- No objects were created, moved, or removed.  
- No new information about the environment was revealed.  

**Assumptions made before executing `scan()` and their outcomes**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | `scan()` would succeed and return additional perceptual data (e.g., reveal hidden objects). | ❌ Failed – the action did not succeed and gave an error about a key‑locking mismatch. |
| 2️⃣ | The failure would not alter the world state. | ✅ True – everything remains exactly as it was before the action. |
| 3️⃣ | The error message referred to a lock‑related action, not to scanning; the key in inventory would be irrelevant. | ❌ Wrong – the system interpreted the request as an attempt to lock something, so the key became a factor. |
| 4️⃣ | No assumptions about the presence of a potato were affected. | ✅ True – the potato is still absent. |
| 5️⃣ | The door’s open state would stay unchanged. | ✅ True – the door remains open. |

**Short reflection**

The only state change caused by the last step was **none**; the environment stayed exactly as after opening the door. The expectation that `scan()` would reveal new items was incorrect, and the system interpreted the command as a locking attempt, leading to a failure message about the key. All other earlier assumptions (inventory unchanged, door still open, no potato) remain valid. The next useful move is to obtain a potato (e.g., create or locate one) before trying to place anything on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **No – the plan step is not completed.**  

The most recent action was `scan()`, but the system returned a failure (“That key cannot lock this object…”) and produced no new information or state change. Since the scan did not succeed and did not reveal anything, the intended step has not been achieved. The next step should address the failure (e.g., try a different observation action or acquire a potato) before moving on.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **No – the plan step is not completed.**  

The most recent action was `scan()`, but the system returned a failure (“That key cannot lock this object…”) and produced no new information or state change. Since the scan did not succeed and did not reveal anything, the intended step has not been achieved. The next step should address the failure (e.g., try a different observation action or acquire a potato) before moving on.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The plan step was to execute scan(), but the action failed with an error and did not produce any new information or state change, so the intended scanning was not successfully completed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**  
The only purpose of the `scan()` step was to reveal hidden items (in particular a potato). The action failed – the system interpreted it as a lock‑related command and reported an error, producing no new information and leaving the world state unchanged. Since the scan gave us nothing and we still have no potato, repeating the same step is unlikely to succeed.

**Decision**  
The current plan is no longer promising. We should adopt a different approach (e.g., move through the now‑open doorway to explore the adjacent area, look for hidden objects, or use any other available action that can create or locate a potato).

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5`.*

**Current situation**  
- Agent at **(4.0, 4.0)** – standing in front of the **open, unlocked** `door_6`.  
- Inventory: **key_4** (carried).  
- `table_5` is at **(0.0, 3.0)** and is empty.

| 2 | `scan()` | – Agent is inside the new room (any location). | System returns a perceptual snapshot of the new area. | If a potato appears in the snapshot → go to step 3. If not, continue exploring (steps 2‑5 loop). |
| 3 | `pick_up(potato)` | – A potato object is present on the same tile as the agent (or within reach). | Potato is removed from the world and added to inventory. | Inventory now contains `potato`. |
| 4 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | – Path from current location to (0.0, 3.0) is free (no locked doors, no obstacles). | Agent travels to the table’s tile. | Agent’s location becomes (0.0, 3.0). |
| 5 | `place(potato, table_5)` | – Inventory holds `potato`.<br>– Agent stands on the same tile as `table_5`. | Potato is removed from inventory and becomes a child of `table_5`. | `table_5` now contains a potato; inventory empty → **goal achieved**. |

### Contingency loop (if no potato is found after step 2)

| # | Action | Reason |
|---|--------|--------|
| 2a | `move(5.0, 5.0)` (or any adjacent free tile) | Explore another part of the new room. |
| 2b | `scan()` again | Look for hidden objects. |

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Current facts (after the last failed `move(4.0, 5.0)`):**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 4.0) – still standing in front of `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | holds **key_4** (the key is not on the floor). |
| **Door `door_6`** | **open** and **unlocked**. |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), empty. |
| **Key `key_4`** | no longer on the floor (carried). |
| **Potato** | not present anywhere in the room. |
| **Room bounds** | `extend_y` = 4.0, so any y > 4.0 is outside the map. |
| **Last action result** | `move(4.0, 5.0)` → **failure** (attempted to leave the room). |

### Assumptions made before each action and their outcomes  

| # | Action | Assumption(s) | Outcome |
|---|--------|----------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | `move(4.0, 1.0) → (3.0, 1.0)` | • Tile (3.0, 1.0) is reachable.<br>• No objects block the path. | ✅ True – agent arrived at (3.0, 1.0). |
| 2️⃣ | `pick_up(key_4)` | • Agent stands on the key (pre‑condition satisfied).<br>• Picking up transfers the key to inventory and removes it from the floor. | ✅ True – key now in inventory, floor empty. |
| 3️⃣ | `move(3.0, 1.0) → (4.0, 4.0)` | • Path to (4.0, 4.0) is clear.<br>• Inventory stays unchanged. | ✅ True – agent at door, still holds the key. |
| 4️⃣ | `open(door_6)` | • Door is reachable and unlocked, so it can be opened without using the key.<br>• Opening does not consume the key or affect other objects. | ✅ True – door becomes **open**, key remains in inventory. |
| 5️⃣ | `scan()` (intended to learn more) | • `scan` will return perceptual data without side‑effects.<br>• No lock‑related logic is involved. | ❌ False – system interpreted it as a lock attempt, returned an error about the key. No state change. |
| 6️⃣ | `move(4.0, 5.0)` | • Tile (4.0, 5.0) exists inside the room and is reachable. | ❌ False – (4.0, 5.0) is outside `extend_y = 4.0`; move failed, position unchanged. |

**All other implicit assumptions (e.g., “no potato appears spontaneously”, “other objects stay where they are unless acted on”) held true throughout.**

---

### Short reflection  

The sequence of actions successfully let the agent acquire the key and open the door, but it **did not produce a potato**—the core missing piece for the original goal “place a potato on the table.”  

The only state changes are:

* key → inventory,
* door → open,
* agent’s location = (4.0, 4.0).

The last attempted move was impossible because it exceeded the room’s y‑boundary, confirming the room‑size constraint.  

**Next logical step:** obtain a potato (e.g., look for one, create one, or request it) before trying to place anything on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The focused plan step **move(4.0, 5.0)** has **not** been completed.  
The most recent reflection notes that the attempted move failed because the target tile (4.0, 5.0) lies outside the room’s `extend_y = 4.0`. The agent’s position remains at (4.0, 4.0), so the intended move did not succeed. Hence the plan step is still pending.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The focused plan step **move(4.0, 5.0)** has **not** been completed.  
The most recent reflection notes that the attempted move failed because the target tile (4.0, 5.0) lies outside the room’s `extend_y = 4.0`. The agent’s position remains at (4.0, 4.0), so the intended move did not succeed. Hence the plan step is still pending.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The last attempted move to (4.0, 5.0) failed because the target tile is outside the room bounds (extend_y = 4.0). The agent remains at (4.0, 4.0), so the plan step move(4.0, 5.0) was not successfully executed.. Does it still seem promising?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The room’s vertical limit is `extend_y = 4.0`.  
- The target tile **(4.0, 5.0)** lies outside that limit, so the environment rejects the command as an illegal move.  
- Because the move cannot be carried out, the agent will stay at **(4.0, 4.0)** and no new information or objects will appear.  
- The original goal (“place a potato on the table”) still lacks a potato, and the only useful actions now are ones that are *legal* and that can bring a potato into the world (e.g., `create(potato)`, `spawn(potato)`, or `move` to a location where a potato already exists).

**Conclusion**

The step `move(4.0, 5.0)` is **not promising** – it is impossible given the room bounds. Choose a different, feasible action that moves the agent within the room or introduces a potato before attempting to place it on the table.

Question: The focused plan step is not completed because: The last attempted move to (4.0, 5.0) failed because the target tile is outside the room bounds (extend_y = 4.0). The agent remains at (4.0, 4.0), so the plan step move(4.0, 5.0) was not successfully executed.. Does it still seem promising?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The room’s vertical limit is `extend_y = 4.0`.  
- The target tile **(4.0, 5.0)** lies outside that limit, so the environment rejects the command as an illegal move.  
- Because the move cannot be carried out, the agent will stay at **(4.0, 4.0)** and no new information or objects will appear.  
- The original goal (“place a potato on the table”) still lacks a potato, and the only useful actions now are ones that are *legal* and that can bring a potato into the world (e.g., `create(potato)`, `spawn(potato)`, or `move` to a location where a potato already exists).

**Conclusion**

The step `move(4.0, 5.0)` is **not promising** – it is impossible given the room bounds. Choose a different, feasible action that moves the agent within the room or introduces a potato before attempting to place it on the table.

Replanning because The target tile (4.0, 5.0) lies outside the room bounds (extend_y = 4.0), making the move impossible. Since the action cannot be executed, it will not advance toward obtaining a potato or placing it on the table, so the plan step is not promising.

**Current state (summary)**  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Agent location | (4.0, 4.0) – in front of **door_6** (open & unlocked) |
| Inventory | **key_4** (carried) |
| **door_6** | open, unlocked |
| **table_5** | empty, at (0.0, 3.0) |
| Potato | *not visible* anywhere in the known part of the room |
| Room bounds | `extend_y = 4.0` (so any y > 4.0 is outside the map) |

The only missing object for the goal is a **potato**.  
We therefore need to **locate** (or create) a potato, **pick it up**, and **put it on the table**.

Below is a **structured, conditional plan** that works no‑matter whether the potato is already present somewhere reachable or needs to be created.  
Each step lists:

* **Action** – the command to issue.  
* **Pre‑conditions** – facts that must hold before the action can succeed.  
* **Post‑conditions / Expected outcome** – what will be true after the action (if it succeeds).  
* **Fallback** – what to do if the action fails (e.g., object not found).

## 1️⃣  Explore the area behind the open door

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 1.1 | `move(4.0, 3.0)` | Agent at (4.0, 4.0); tile (4.0, 3.0) is inside room and not blocked. | Agent now at (4.0, 3.0) – just south of the doorway, still inside the same room. | If the move fails (blocked), try an alternative adjacent tile such as `move(3.0, 4.0)`. |
| 1.2 | `move(3.0, 3.0)` | Agent at (4.0, 3.0); tile (3.0, 3.0) is free. | Agent now at (3.0, 3.0). This position is one step closer to the centre of the room and usually gives line‑of‑sight toward hidden objects. | If blocked, explore another free neighbour (e.g., (4.0, 2.0) or (2.0, 3.0)). |

*Why this matters:*  Moving a bit away from the door puts the agent inside the main floor area where any hidden potato is likely to be placed.

---

## 2️⃣  Look for a potato in the current vicinity

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 2.1 | `scan()` (or `look()` – whichever the environment recognises) | Agent at a location inside the room; scan action is allowed. | The system returns a list of visible objects and their coordinates. **If a potato appears in the list**, record its location `pot_x, pot_y`. | If the scan reports *“nothing new”* or returns an error, proceed to step 3 (create a potato). |

*Note:*  In the previous attempt `scan()` was interpreted as a lock‑related command because of a syntax issue. Use the **exact command name** that the platform expects for a visual scan (`scan` without any arguments is the usual form). If the platform only supports a `look` action, replace `scan()` with `look()`.

---

## 3️⃣  (Conditional) **If the potato was found** – pick it up and bring it to the table  

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 3.1 | `move(pot_x, pot_y)` | Agent’s current location; the potato’s coordinates `pot_x, pot_y` are reachable (no obstacle). | Agent stands on the same tile as the potato. | If the move fails (obstacle), try an alternative path around the obstacle (e.g., move to a neighbour then to the potato). |
| 3.2 | `pick_up(potato)` | Agent is on the same tile as the potato; inventory has free slot. | Potato is removed from the floor and added to the inventory. | If pick‑up fails (e.g., potato is stuck), try `use(key_4, potato)` or `unlock(potato)` – but most worlds allow a simple pick‑up. |
| 3.3 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Agent holding the potato; path to the table is clear. | Agent arrives at the table location. | If blocked, take a detour (e.g., go around the table via (1.0, 3.0) → (0.0, 2.0) → (0.0, 3.0)). |
| 3.4 | `place(potato, table_5)` (or `put_on(potato, table_5)`) | Agent at (0.0, 3.0); potato in inventory; table is empty. | Potato is transferred from inventory onto **table_5**; table now contains a potato; inventory no longer has the potato. | If the action name is not accepted, try `drop(potato)` while standing on the table tile. |

*Success condition:* `table_5` contains a potato → **Goal achieved**.

---

## 4️⃣  (Conditional) **If the potato was *not* found** – create one and place it

Many sandbox environments allow a “create” or “spawn” action for test purposes. If the platform supports it, use it; otherwise ask the system for a helper action.

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 4.1 | `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`) | Agent is in a location where creation is allowed (usually any free tile). | A new potato object appears on the agent’s current tile and can be picked up. | If the environment rejects creation, issue `request(potato)` or `ask_for(potato)` – some worlds have a “hint” or “give” command. |
| 4.2 | `pick_up(potato)` | Potato is on the same tile; inventory free. | Potato moves to inventory. | – |
| 4.3 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Agent holding the potato; path to the table is clear. | Agent reaches the table tile. | – |
| 4.4 | `place(potato, table_5)` (or `drop(potato)`) | Agent on table tile; potato in inventory; table empty. | Potato ends up on the table; goal satisfied. | – |

---

## 5️⃣  Verify the goal

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 5.1 | `inspect(table_5)` (or simply `look()` after moving to the table) | Agent at (0.0, 3.0). | System reports **“table_5 contains potato”** → Goal confirmed. |

---

### Summary of the whole plan (linearised for execution)

1. `move(4.0, 3.0)`  
2. `move(3.0, 3.0)`  
3. `scan()` (or `look()`) → if potato found → go to **Section 3**; else go to **Section 4**.  

**If potato found:**  
4a. `move(pot_x, pot_y)`  
5a. `pick_up(potato)`  
6a. `move(0.0, 3.0)`  
7a. `place(potato, table_5)`  

**If potato not found:**  
4b. `create(potato)` (or request one)  
5b. `pick_up(potato)`  
6b. `move(0.0, 3.0)`  
7b. `place(potato, table_5)`  

8. `inspect(table_5)` → confirms success.

---

### What to do next

*Issue the first action `move(4.0, 3.0)`.*  
After each action, report the resulting world state so we can decide which branch (found‑potato vs. create‑potato) to follow. This incremental feedback ensures we stay consistent with the actual environment and reach the goal efficiently.

Use the **exact command name** that the platform expects for a visual scan (`scan` without any arguments is the usual form). If the platform only supports a `look` action, replace `scan()` with `look()`.

## 3️⃣  (Conditional) **If the potato was found** – pick it up and bring it to the table  

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 3.1 | `move(pot_x, pot_y)` | Agent’s current location; the potato’s coordinates `pot_x, pot_y` are reachable (no obstacle). | Agent stands on the same tile as the potato. | If the move fails (obstacle), try an alternative path around the obstacle (e.g., move to a neighbour then to the potato). |
| 3.2 | `pick_up(potato)` | Agent is on the same tile as the potato; inventory has free slot. | Potato is removed from the floor and added to the inventory. | If pick‑up fails (e.g., potato is stuck), try `use(key_4, potato)` or `unlock(potato)` – but most worlds allow a simple pick‑up. |
| 3.3 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Agent holding the potato; path to the table is clear. | Agent arrives at the table location. | If blocked, take a detour (e.g., go around the table via (1.0, 3.0) → (0.0, 2.0) → (0.0, 3.0)). |
| 3.4 | `place(potato, table_5)` (or `put_on(potato, table_5)`) | Agent at (0.0, 3.0); potato in inventory; table is empty. | Potato is transferred from inventory onto **table_5**; table now contains a potato; inventory no longer has the potato. | If the action name is not accepted, try `drop(potato)` while standing on the table tile. |

*Success condition:* `table_5` contains a potato → **Goal achieved**.

---

## 4️⃣  (Conditional) **If the potato was *not* found** – create one and place it

Many sandbox environments allow a “create” or “spawn” action for test purposes. If the platform supports it, use it; otherwise ask the system for a helper action.

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome | Fallback |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| 4.1 | `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`) | Agent is in a location where creation is allowed (usually any free tile). | A new potato object appears on the agent’s current tile and can be picked up. | If the environment rejects creation, issue `request(potato)` or `ask_for(potato)` – some worlds have a “hint” or “give” command. |
| 4.2 | `pick_up(potato)` | Potato is on the same tile; inventory free. | Potato moves to inventory. | – |
| 4.3 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Agent holding the potato; path to the table is clear. | Agent reaches the table tile. | – |
| 4.4 | `place(potato, table_5)` (or `drop(potato)`) | Agent on table tile; potato in inventory; table empty. | Potato ends up on the table; goal satisfied. | – |

---

## 5️⃣  Verify the goal

| # | Action | Pre‑conditions | Post‑conditions / Expected outcome |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 5.1 | `inspect(table_5)` (or simply `look()` after moving to the table) | Agent at (0.0, 3.0). | System reports **“table_5 contains potato”** → Goal confirmed. |

---

### Summary of the whole plan (linearised for execution)

1. `move(4.0, 3.0)`  
2. `move(3.0, 3.0)`  
3. `scan()` (or `look()`) → if potato found → go to **Section 3**; else go to **Section 4**.  

**If potato found:**  
4a. `move(pot_x, pot_y)`  
5a. `pick_up(potato)`  
6a. `move(0.0, 3.0)`  
7a. `place(potato, table_5)`  

**If potato not found:**  
4b. `create(potato)` (or request one)  
5b. `pick_up(potato)`  
6b. `move(0.0, 3.0)`  
7b. `place(potato, table_5)`  

8. `inspect(table_5)` → confirms success.

---

### What to do next

*Issue the first action `move(4.0, 3.0)`.*  
After each action, report the resulting world state so we can decide which branch (found‑potato vs. create‑potato) to follow. This incremental feedback ensures we stay consistent with the actual environment and reach the goal efficiently.
Use toolcalls to add the steps specified in the plan for the user.

[reflector] ### New facts after **move(4.0, 3.0)**  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 3.0) – one tile south of the door. |
| **Inventory** | still contains **key_4** (unchanged). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), still **empty**. |
| **Key `key_4`** | remains **in inventory** (no longer on the floor). |
| **Potato** | still **absent** from the room. |
| **Room bounds** | (x∈[0,4], y∈[0,4]) – the new tile (4.0, 3.0) is inside the map. |

No other objects were moved, created, or removed.

---

### Assumptions made before the move  

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Tile **(4.0, 3.0)** is reachable – no obstacle blocks the path. | ✅ True; the agent successfully stepped onto the tile. |
| 2️⃣ | The move stays **inside the room bounds** (y ≤ 4.0). | ✅ True; (4.0, 3.0) is within the allowed area. |
| 3️⃣ | **Inventory is preserved** while walking. | ✅ True; key_4 is still in the inventory. |
| 4️⃣ | **Door state** does not change simply by moving away from it. | ✅ True; door_6 remains open‑unlocked. |
| 5️⃣ | **Table and other objects** stay where they are unless acted upon. | ✅ True; table_5 and the (non‑existent) potato are unchanged. |
| 6️⃣ | No new items (e.g., a potato) appear spontaneously because of movement. | ✅ True; potato is still absent. |

All assumptions held; the action produced exactly the expected state change (only the agent’s coordinates were updated).  

---  

**Short reflection** – The environment is now slightly more open: the agent stands just south of the open doorway, still holding the key, with the table still empty and the potato missing. The next useful step is to acquire a potato (e.g., locate, create, or request one) before attempting to place it on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes, the planned step is complete.**  
- The last action executed was `move(4.0, 3.0)`.  
- The resulting facts show the agent’s location is now **(4.0, 3.0)**, exactly the tile the plan aimed to reach.  
- All other state elements (inventory, door, table, absence of a potato) remain unchanged, confirming that only the intended movement occurred.  

Thus the focus “move the agent south one tile to (4.0, 3.0)” has been successfully carried out.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **Yes, the planned step is complete.**  
- The last action executed was `move(4.0, 3.0)`.  
- The resulting facts show the agent’s location is now **(4.0, 3.0)**, exactly the tile the plan aimed to reach.  
- All other state elements (inventory, door, table, absence of a potato) remain unchanged, confirming that only the intended movement occurred.  

Thus the focus “move the agent south one tile to (4.0, 3.0)” has been successfully carried out.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the goal has not been reached.

**Reasoning:**  
- The table `table_5` is still empty.  
- There is no potato anywhere in the room (the world state still lists “Potato: absent”).  
- The agent only moved to a new position and still holds the key; none of these actions created or placed a potato.  

Since the required condition “a potato is on the table” is not satisfied, the main goal remains unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the goal has not been reached.

**Reasoning:**  
- The table `table_5` is still empty.  
- There is no potato anywhere in the room (the world state still lists “Potato: absent”).  
- The agent only moved to a new position and still holds the key; none of these actions created or placed a potato.  

Since the required condition “a potato is on the table” is not satisfied, the main goal remains unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5` (the table at (0.0, 3.0)).*  

Current state (summarised)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 3.0) – just south of the open door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | `key_4` (still carried). |
| **Door `door_6`** | open & unlocked (at 4.0, 4.0). |

The only missing ingredient is a **potato**.  
Below is a **structured, hierarchical plan** that first obtains a potato (by searching the environment or, if none is found, by creating one) and then puts it on the table.

## 1️⃣ High‑level plan

```
GET POTATO → GO TO TABLE → PUT POTATO ON TABLE
```

---

## 2️⃣ Detailed sub‑plans

### 2.1. GET POTATO

| Step | Action (with arguments) | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2.1‑a | `scan_room()` (or `look_around()`) | Agent can sense the current tile and adjacent tiles. | Returns a list of visible objects (e.g., a potato) and may reveal hidden items. |
| 2.1‑b | **If a potato is reported** → `move_to(potato_location)` | Tile reachable, within bounds, no obstacle. | Agent stands on the potato’s tile. |
| 2.1‑c | `pick_up(potato)` | Agent is on the same tile as the potato, potato is pick‑able. | Potato is removed from the floor and added to inventory. |
| 2.1‑d | **If no potato is reported** → `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`) | The environment permits creation of objects. | A new potato appears on the agent’s current tile. |
| 2.1‑e | `pick_up(potato)` (if step 2.1‑d was used) | Same as 2.1‑c. | Potato now in inventory. |

*Fallback:* If `create(potato)` fails (action not supported), repeat the scan after moving to another promising location (e.g., behind the door at (4,4) or the far‑west corner (0,0)).  

---

### 2.2. GO TO TABLE

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2.2‑a | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Tile (0,3) is inside the map and reachable (no blocking walls). | Agent arrives directly at the table’s tile. |
| 2.2‑b | *(If direct path is blocked)* `pathfind_to(0.0, 3.0)` – a sequence of `move(x,y)` steps navigating around obstacles. | Each intermediate tile is reachable. | Agent ends on the table tile. |

*(Because the map is only 5 × 5 and the door is already open, a straight move to (0,3) is normally possible.)*

---

### 2.3. PUT POTATO ON TABLE

## 4️⃣ Contingency table

| Situation | How to recover |
|-----------|----------------|
| **`scan_room()` reports nothing** | Use `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`). |
| **`create(potato)` is unknown / fails** | Move to another tile (e.g., (4,4) behind the door) and `scan_room()` again; repeat until a potato appears, or finally request a “spawn” action. |
| **Movement to (0,3) is blocked** | Use a series of `move` steps around the obstacle (e.g., (4,2) → (3,2) → … → (0,3)). |
| **`put(potato, table_5)` fails** | Ensure the agent is exactly on the table tile and the potato is still in inventory; if not, re‑pick‑up the potato (`pick_up(potato)`) and retry. |

## 5️⃣ Expected final world state

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (0.0, 3.0) – standing on the table. |
| **Inventory** | empty (the key may still be carried if you wish to keep it, but it is not required for the goal). |
| **Table `table_5`** | contains **potato**. |
| **Potato** | no longer a separate object on the floor; it is now on the table. |
| **Door `door_6`** | unchanged (open & unlocked). |
| **Key `key_4`** | still in inventory (optional). |

The goal *“place a potato on the table”* is satisfied.  

---  

**Next step:** Execute the actions in the order shown above (or a logically equivalent variant). If any action fails, follow the corresponding contingency in the table. Good luck!

[user] Plan: **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5` (the table at (0.0, 3.0)).*  

Current state (summarised)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 3.0) – just south of the open door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | `key_4` (still carried). |
| **Door `door_6`** | open & unlocked (at 4.0, 4.0). |
| **Table `table_5`** | empty (at 0.0, 3.0). |
| **Potato** | **not present** anywhere in the room. |
| **Room bounds** | x∈[0,4], y∈[0,4]. |

The only missing ingredient is a **potato**.  
Below is a **structured, hierarchical plan** that first obtains a potato (by searching the environment or, if none is found, by creating one) and then puts it on the table.

## 1️⃣ High‑level plan

```
GET POTATO → GO TO TABLE → PUT POTATO ON TABLE
```

---

## 2️⃣ Detailed sub‑plans

### 2.1. GET POTATO

| Step | Action (with arguments) | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2.1‑a | `scan_room()` (or `look_around()`) | Agent can sense the current tile and adjacent tiles. | Returns a list of visible objects (e.g., a potato) and may reveal hidden items. |
| 2.1‑b | **If a potato is reported** → `move_to(potato_location)` | Tile reachable, within bounds, no obstacle. | Agent stands on the potato’s tile. |
| 2.1‑c | `pick_up(potato)` | Agent is on the same tile as the potato, potato is pick‑able. | Potato is removed from the floor and added to inventory. |
| 2.1‑d | **If no potato is reported** → `create(potato)` (or `spawn(potato)`) | The environment permits creation of objects. | A new potato appears on the agent’s current tile. |
| 2.1‑e | `pick_up(potato)` (if step 2.1‑d was used) | Same as 2.1‑c. | Potato now in inventory. |

*Fallback:* If `create(potato)` fails (action not supported), repeat the scan after moving to another promising location (e.g., behind the door at (4,4) or the far‑west corner (0,0)).  

---

### 2.2. GO TO TABLE

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2.2‑a | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Tile (0,3) is inside the map and reachable (no blocking walls). | Agent arrives directly at the table’s tile. |
| 2.2‑b | *(If direct path is blocked)* `pathfind_to(0.0, 3.0)` – a sequence of `move(x,y)` steps navigating around obstacles. | Each intermediate tile is reachable. | Agent ends on the table tile. |

*(Because the map is only 5 × 5 and the door is already open, a straight move to (0,3) is normally possible.)*

---

### 2.3. PUT POTATO ON TABLE

| Step | Action | Preconditions | Expected effect |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2.3‑a | `put(potato, table_5)` | Agent is standing on the same tile as `table_5`; potato is currently in inventory. | Potato is removed from inventory and placed on `table_5`. The table’s state becomes “contains potato”. |
| 2.3‑b | `verify(table_5)` (optional) | – | Returns confirmation that the potato is on the table. |

[reflector] **What happened**

1. **`move(4.0, 3.0)`** – the agent stepped one tile south of the open doorway.

   *Effect*: no new perceptual information was produced; the world state is unchanged.

### Current facts (after both actions)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 3.0) – just south of the open door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | contains **key_4** (still in hand). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0), **open** and **unlocked**. |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), **empty**. |
| **Key `key_4`** | **in inventory** (no longer on the floor). |
| **Potato** | **absent** from the room. |
| **Room bounds** | x ∈ [0, 4], y ∈ [0, 4]; (4.0, 3.0) is inside the map. |
| **Last action result** | `scan_room()` → “.” (no new data). |

---

### Assumptions made before the actions and their outcomes

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Tile (4.0, 3.0) is reachable and not blocked. | ✅ True – the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | Moving does not alter inventory, door state, table contents, or create a potato. | ✅ True – only the agent’s position changed. |
| 3️⃣ | The move stays inside the room limits (y ≤ 4.0). | ✅ True – (4.0, 3.0) is within bounds. |
| 4️⃣ | `scan_room()` will return perceptual data *if* there is anything new to report. | ✅ True – the return “.” signifies “nothing new”. |
| 5️⃣ | `scan_room()` will *not* modify the world state. | ✅ True – no objects were added, removed, or changed. |
| 6️⃣ | No potato will appear spontaneously because of moving or scanning. | ✅ True – the potato is still missing. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions were observed.

---

### Short reflection

The environment is now fully accessible: the door is open, the agent stands just south of it, and the key is safely in inventory. The only missing piece for the original goal (“place a potato on the table”) is still the **potato**—nothing in the recent actions created or revealed one. The latest scan confirmed that the world contains no new items or state changes.

**Next logical step:** obtain a potato (e.g., request it, spawn it, or locate it elsewhere) before trying to place anything on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The plan’s current step was to execute **`scan_room()`**.  
The most recent reflection shows that `scan_room()` was already performed, returned “.” (no new data), and left the world state unchanged. Therefore the intended action has been carried out.

**Answer:** Yes, the focused plan step is completed.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The main goal is **not** reached.  
The table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty and there is no potato anywhere in the room; the agent only holds a key. Since the required potato has not been obtained or placed, the goal “place a potato on the table” remains unmet.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: The main goal is **not** reached.  
The table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty and there is no potato anywhere in the room; the agent only holds a key. Since the required potato has not been obtained or placed, the goal “place a potato on the table” remains unmet.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[plan_imaginator] ## Goal  
**Place a potato on `table_5` (located at (0.0, 3.0)).**

---

## Current world state (for reference)

| Entity | Location / State | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Agent | (4.0, 3.0) – just south of the open door `door_6` | |
| `key_4` | **in inventory** | |
| `door_6` | (4.0, 4.0) – **open** & **unlocked** | can be walked through |
| `table_5` | (0.0, 3.0) – **empty** | |
| **Potato** | **not present** anywhere in the current room | must be obtained |
| Room bounds | x ∈ [0, 4], y ∈ [0, 4] | (4.0, 4.0) is the northern edge; stepping through `door_6` leads to the *adjacent* room (outside the current bounds). |

---

## High‑level strategy  

1. **Exit the current room through the open door** – the adjacent room (or hallway) is where a potato is expected to be (or where we can create one).  
2. **Locate a potato** – either by finding an existing one or by creating one if none is present.  
3. **Bring the potato back** to the original room.  
4. **Place the potato on `table_5`.**

---

## Detailed, step‑by‑step plan  

| # | Action | Preconditions | Expected outcome / effect |
|---|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | `move(4.0, 4.0)` | Agent at (4.0, 3.0); tile (4.0, 4.0) is not blocked. | Agent stands on the doorway tile, still holding `key_4`. |
| 2 | `move_through(door_6)` *(or `move(4.0, 4.5)` if the engine allows stepping beyond the map)* | `door_6` is **open**; the space just beyond the door is traversable. | Agent enters the adjacent room / hallway. The new coordinates will be reported by the environment (e.g., `(4.0, 4.5)` or a new room ID). |
| 3 | `scan_room()` | Agent is inside the new area. | Returns a description of everything present. **Two possibilities:**<br> a) *A potato* (`potato_1`) is listed.<br> b) No potato appears. |
| 4a | *If a potato is found:* `pick_up(potato_1)` | Potato is on the same tile as the agent. | `potato_1` moves from the floor to the inventory; the floor tile becomes empty. |
| 4b | *If no potato is found:* `create(potato_1)` *(or `spawn(potato)`)** | The environment permits creation actions. | A new `potato_1` appears on the agent’s current tile and can be picked up immediately (or will be automatically added to inventory). |
| 5 | `move_back_to(door_6)` | Agent holding the potato (or having it in inventory). | Agent walks back to the doorway tile (4.0, 4.0). |
| 6 | `move(4.0, 3.0)` | Door tile is clear; the tile (4.0, 3.0) is free. | Agent returns to the original room, standing just south of the door, still holding the potato. |
| 7 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Path from (4.0, 3.0) to (0.0, 3.0) is unobstructed (no walls/objects on the way). | Agent arrives at the location of `table_5`. |
| 8 | `place(potato_1, table_5)` | Agent has `potato_1` in inventory and is standing on the same tile as `table_5`. | `potato_1` is removed from inventory and placed on `table_5`. The table now contains a potato – **goal achieved**. |

---

## Contingency handling  

| Situation | Alternate step(s) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Step 2 fails** (door leads to a blocked tile) | *Try a different exit*: If another door exists in the room, `move` to that door, `open` it if closed, and repeat steps 2‑8. |
| **Step 3 returns “no objects” and the environment does **not** allow `create`** | Look for a container (e.g., `cabinet_2`, `chest_1`) in the new room: <br>• `open(container)` → may reveal a potato.<br>• If a container is locked, use `key_4` (or another key if found) to unlock it. |
| **Step 7 is blocked** (an unexpected obstacle appears en route) | Use `move` commands to circumvent the obstacle (e.g., move around it via alternative coordinates). If the path truly is blocked, search the room for a *switch* or *lever* that may open a hidden passage. |
| **`place` fails because the table is occupied** | First `remove` the existing item (if any) with `pick_up` or `clear(table_5)`, then redo the `place`. |

---

## Minimal viable execution (assuming the straightforward case)

```
move(4.0, 4.0)                # step onto the door
move_through(door_6)          # enter the next room
scan_room()                   # see what is there
# -> if a potato appears:
pick_up(potato_1)             # take it
# -> else (no potato):
create(potato_1)              # spawn one
move_back_to(door_6)          # return to the doorway
move(4.0, 3.0)                # back inside the original room
move(0.0, 3.0)                # go to the table
place(potato_1, table_5)      # put the potato on the table
```

Executing the sequence above will satisfy the original objective: **the table now holds a potato**. If any step fails, follow the contingency table to adjust the plan accordingly.

### Updated facts (after the move)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (4.0, 4.0) – now standing on the open door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | still holds **key_4** (unchanged). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), **empty** (unchanged). |
| **Key `key_4`** | **in inventory** (not on the floor). |
| **Potato** | **absent** from the room. |
| **Room bounds** | x ∈ [0, 4], y ∈ [0, 4]; the new tile (4.0, 4.0) is inside the map. |

No other objects were created, moved or removed.

### Assumptions made before the move

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Tile **(4.0, 4.0)** is reachable – no obstacle blocks the path. | ✅ True; the move succeeded. |
| 2️⃣ | The move stays **inside the room bounds** (y ≤ 4.0). | ✅ True; (4.0, 4.0) is within the allowed area. |
| 3️⃣ | **Inventory** is preserved while walking. | ✅ True; `key_4` remains in hand. |
| 4️⃣ | **Door state** does not change merely by stepping onto it. | ✅ True; `door_6` stays open‑unlocked. |
| 5️⃣ | **Table and other objects** remain where they are unless acted upon. | ✅ True; `table_5` is still empty. |
| 6️⃣ | No new items (e.g., a potato) appear spontaneously because of movement. | ✅ True; the potato is still missing. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions were observed.

### Short reflection  

The only world‑state change caused by the last action is the **agent’s position**, now on the open doorway. Everything else—inventory, door status, table emptiness, and the absence of a potato—remains exactly as before. The environment is fully accessible, but the core missing element for the original goal (“place a potato on the table”) is still absent. The next logical step is to obtain or create a potato before attempting to place it on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The last action was `move(4.0, 4.0)`, which succeeded and placed the agent on the tile of the open door. Since the plan’s focused step was exactly that move, the step has already been executed. **Thus the plan step is completed.**

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: The last action was `move(4.0, 4.0)`, which succeeded and placed the agent on the tile of the open door. Since the plan’s focused step was exactly that move, the step has already been executed. **Thus the plan step is completed.**
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] The main goal **has not been reached**.  
The agent is standing on the open doorway, holding the key, while the table at (0.0, 3.0) is still empty and there is no potato in the room. Without a potato on the table, the goal remains unmet.

|------|-------|
| Agent location | (4.0, 4.0) – standing on the open door `door_6`. |
| Inventory | `key_4` (no potato yet). |

No obstacles are known besides the closed‑door tile (now open) and the table itself. All floor tiles are traversable.

## Structured plan to achieve the goal

| Step | Action | Reason / Expected effect |
|------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1 | `move(3.0, 4.0)` | Walk west one tile, staying inside the room. |
| 2 | `move(2.0, 4.0)` | Continue west toward the table side of the room. |
| 3 | `move(1.0, 4.0)` | Near the western wall, still north of the table. |
| 4 | `move(0.0, 4.0)` | Reach the westernmost column, directly above the table’s x‑coordinate. |
| 5 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Step onto the tile occupied by `table_5`. Most environments allow the agent to stand on the same tile as a table (the table is a surface, not a wall). If the system forbids standing on the table, the agent can stay on (0.0, 4.0) and the subsequent `place` will still succeed because the table is adjacent. |
| 6 | `create(potato, 0.0, 2.0)` | Spawn a potato on the floor directly **south** of the table (still inside bounds). The potato now exists in the world. |
| 7 | `move(0.0, 2.0)` | Walk onto the potato’s tile. |
| 8 | `pick_up(potato)` | Acquire the potato; it is removed from the floor and placed in the inventory. |
| 9 | `move(0.0, 3.0)` | Return to the table’s tile (or stay adjacent if standing on the table isn’t allowed). |
|10| `place(potato, table_5)` | Put the potato onto the surface of `table_5`. The table’s state becomes “contains potato”. |
|11| *(optional)* `drop(key_4)` | If you’d like the key back on the floor, you can drop it; not required for the goal. |

---

### Why this plan works
* **All moves stay within the room bounds** (`extend_x = 4.0`, `extend_y = 4.0`).  
* **No existing objects block the path** – the only floor objects are the door (now open, traversable) and the table (a placeable surface).  
* **`create(potato, …)`** is the standard way to introduce a missing object when the environment permits it.  
* **`pick_up` → `place`** is the canonical sequence for moving an item from the floor onto a surface.  
* After step 10 the factual state will be:  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| `table_5` | contains **potato** (goal achieved). |
| Agent location | (0.0, 3.0) (or adjacent). |
| Inventory | still holds `key_4` (potato is no longer there). |

---

### Execution notes
* If the system does **not** allow the agent to occupy the same tile as a table, simply keep the agent on (0.0, 4.0) after step 5, and in step 9 move back to (0.0, 4.0) before issuing `place(potato, table_5)`. The `place` action works from an adjacent tile in that case.  
* If `create` is unavailable, you can ask the environment to `spawn(potato, …)` or a similar synonym; the plan otherwise stays identical.  

Proceed with the actions in the order listed above to fulfil the goal “place a potato on the table”.

### Execution notes
* If the system does **not** allow the agent to occupy the same tile as a table, simply keep the agent on (0.0, 4.0) after step 5, and in step 9 move back to (0.0, 4.0) before issuing `place(potato, table_5)`. The `place` action works from an adjacent tile in that case.  
* If `create` is unavailable, you can ask the environment to `spawn(potato, …)` or a similar synonym; the plan otherwise stays identical.  

Proceed with the actions in the order listed above to fulfil the goal “place a potato on the table”.
Use toolcalls to add the steps specified in the plan for the user.

### Current facts (after the move)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Agent location** | (3.0, 4.0) – just west of the open door `door_6`. |
| **Inventory** | still contains **key_4** (unchanged). |
| **Door `door_6`** | at (4.0, 4.0), **open** and **unlocked** (unchanged). |
| **Table `table_5`** | at (0.0, 3.0), **empty** (unchanged). |
| **Key `key_4`** | **in inventory** (not on the floor). |
| **Potato** | **absent** from the room. |
| **Room bounds** | x ∈ [0, 4], y ∈ [0, 4]; (3.0, 4.0) is inside the map. |
| **Last action result** | movement succeeded, no other state changes. |

---

### Assumptions made before `move(3.0, 4.0)` and their outcomes

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Tile **(3.0, 4.0)** is reachable – no obstacle blocks the path. | **✅ True** – the agent arrived at the tile. |
| 2️⃣ | The move stays **inside the room bounds** (x ≤ 4, y ≤ 4). | **✅ True** – (3.0, 4.0) is within the allowed area. |
| 3️⃣ | **Inventory is preserved** while walking. | **✅ True** – `key_4` remains in the inventory. |
| 4️⃣ | **Door state does not change** merely by stepping away from it. | **✅ True** – `door_6` is still open‑unlocked. |
| 5️⃣ | **Table and other objects** stay where they are unless acted upon. | **✅ True** – `table_5` stays empty. |
| 6️⃣ | No new items (e.g., a potato) appear spontaneously because of movement. | **✅ True** – the potato is still absent. |

All assumptions held; there were no contradictions.

### Short reflection  

The only change in the world is the agent’s position, now at **(3.0, 4.0)**, a safe tile just west of the open doorway. Everything else—key in inventory, door open, empty table, no potato—remains exactly as before. The environment is fully accessible, but the missing **potato** is still absent, so the original goal “place a potato on the table” cannot yet be achieved. The next logical step is to obtain or create a potato before attempting to put anything on `table_5`.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the step is already completed.**  

The current world state shows the agent at **(3.0, 4.0)**, exactly the destination of the planned `move(3.0, 4.0)`. Since the move was previously executed and the agent’s location matches the target, there is nothing further to do for that step.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the focused plan step completed?
Reasoning: **Yes – the step is already completed.**  

The current world state shows the agent at **(3.0, 4.0)**, exactly the destination of the planned `move(3.0, 4.0)`. Since the move was previously executed and the agent’s location matches the target, there is nothing further to do for that step.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[planner_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the goal has not been reached.

**Reasoning:** The current world state shows that the table (`table_5`) is still empty and there is no potato anywhere in the room. Since the required condition “a potato is on the table” is not satisfied, the main goal remains unmet. The next step is to obtain or create a potato before it can be placed on the table.

Question: Based on the current reflection of the last action, is the initial main goal reached?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the goal has not been reached.

**Reasoning:** The current world state shows that the table (`table_5`) is still empty and there is no potato anywhere in the room. Since the required condition “a potato is on the table” is not satisfied, the main goal remains unmet. The next step is to obtain or create a potato before it can be placed on the table.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Create a new strucutred plan to reach the goal.

[plan_imaginator] **Goal:** *Place a potato on `table_5` (located at (0.0, 3.0)).*  

**Current world state (summary)**  

| Entity | Location | State / Contents |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Agent | (3.0, 4.0) | Inventory = { key_4 } |
| Door `door_6` | (4.0, 4.0) | **open**, **unlocked** |
| Table `table_5` | (0.0, 3.0) | **empty** |
| Potato | **absent** | – |
| Room bounds | x∈[0,4], y∈[0,4] | – |

No obstacles are reported, and the agent can move freely on any tile inside the bounds.

---  

## Structured Plan  

| # | Action (pre‑conditions → post‑conditions) | Reason / Note |
|---|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **1** | `request(potato)`  <br> **Pre:** potato is not in the world.<br> **Post:** potato appears at a known, reachable location, e.g. **(2.0, 2.0)**. | The only way to achieve the goal is to obtain a potato. `request` (or `spawn`) is the standard primitive for “creating” an item that is currently absent. |
| **2** | `move(2.0, 2.0)`  <br> **Pre:** agent at (3.0, 4.0), target tile reachable and inside bounds.<br> **Post:** agent location → (2.0, 2.0). | Walk to the potato. Path is clear (no obstacles reported). |
| **3** | `take(potato)`  <br> **Pre:** agent standing on tile with potato, inventory not full (assume unlimited or at least one free slot).<br> **Post:** potato removed from floor, added to inventory. | Pick up the potato. |
| **4** | `move(0.0, 3.0)`  <br> **Pre:** agent at (2.0, 2.0), target tile reachable.<br> **Post:** agent location → (0.0, 3.0). | Walk to the table’s tile. The table occupies the same tile, but the environment allows the agent to stand on the tile and interact with the table. |
| **5** | `place(potato, table_5)`  <br> **Pre:** agent at (0.0, 3.0), table_5 empty, potato in inventory.<br> **Post:** table_5 now contains potato, potato removed from inventory. | Deposit the potato on the table – goal achieved. |
| **6** *(optional)* | `drop(key_4)`  <br> **Pre:** key_4 still in inventory, no need to carry it further.<br> **Post:** key_4 placed on floor at (0.0, 3.0) or any convenient tile. | Clean‑up step – not required for the primary goal but leaves the inventory tidy. |

### Success criteria
- After step 5, `table_5`’s contents = `{ potato }`.
- The agent may be anywhere; the inventory may still contain `key_4` (or be empty if step 6 is executed).

---  

## Contingency / Alternative Paths  

| Situation | Alternative Action |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **The environment does not support `request`** | Use `spawn(potato, X, Y)` if that primitive is available, or ask the system “*give me a potato*”. |
| **Inventory can hold only one item** | Before `take(potato)`, drop `key_4` on a free tile (e.g., `drop(key_4)` at (3.0, 4.0)) and later retrieve it if needed. |
| **Path blocked by an unexpected obstacle** | Insert a short path‑finding sub‑plan: `move` step‑by‑step around the obstacle, or use `open(door_6)` if a closed door appears. |
| **Potato spawns at a different location** | Adjust step 2 to move to the actual spawn coordinates reported by the system after the `request`. |

---  

## Minimal Command Sequence (to be sent to the simulator)

```
request(potato)
move(2.0, 2.0)
take(potato)
move(0.0, 3.0)
place(potato, table_5)
```

*(Add `drop(key_4)` afterwards if you wish to free the inventory.)*  

Executing the sequence above will satisfy the original objective: a potato will be sitting on `table_5`.
