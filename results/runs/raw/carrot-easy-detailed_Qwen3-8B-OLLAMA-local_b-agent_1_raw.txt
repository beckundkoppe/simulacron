Main goal: Place the carrot from your inventory on the table.
Replanning because Main goal is not yet reached. Create an initial plan

            Based on the current contex: Create a structured plan to reach the goal.
            

[planner] 1. **Check Inventory**: Confirm the carrot is in your inventory.  
2. **Move to Table**: Navigate to the table's location.  
3. **Drop Carrot**: Place the carrot on the table.  

**Minimal Actions**:  
- `go to table`  
- `drop carrot on table`  

No additional steps required if the carrot is already in inventory and the table is accessible.

[observer] The carrot is in your inventory, and the table is empty and accessible. No additional steps needed—proceed to drop the carrot.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (0.5,0.5) to table_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions**:  
- Moved to the table's location (table_3).  

**Facts**:  
- Carrot is in inventory.  
- Table is accessible and empty.  

**Assumptions**:  
- Dropping the carrot at the table will place it there.  

**Validation**:  
- Assumption proved **correct** (table is accessible/empty; no interference).  

**Next Step**:  
`drop carrot on table` (already executed in the plan).

[observer] You are already at the table's location (table_3) and the table is empty. No movement required.
