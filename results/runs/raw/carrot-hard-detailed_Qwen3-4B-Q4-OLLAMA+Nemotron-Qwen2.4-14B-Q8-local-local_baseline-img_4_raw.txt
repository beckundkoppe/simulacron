[user] 
Give best next action to perform (short answer).

[action_imaginator] The goal is to place the carrot from the inventory onto the table. The carrot is already in the inventory, so no "take" action is needed. The human must first move to the table's position at (1.0, 4.0) to interact with it. The minimal action sequence begins with moving to the table, followed by dropping the carrot. Therefore, the next action is to move to the table.

The carrot is already in the inventory, so no "take" action is needed. The human must first move to the table's position at (1.0, 4.0) to interact with it. The minimal action sequence begins with moving to the table, followed by dropping the carrot. Therefore, the next action is to move to the table.

\boxed{\text{move to table}} Task: 
            Give exactly the toolcalls that arise from the planned action.
            Use correct object id.
            Toolcall order matters.
            Your answer must only consist of toolcalls.
