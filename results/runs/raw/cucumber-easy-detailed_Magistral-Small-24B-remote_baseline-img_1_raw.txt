content='```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\nBut reviewing the initial problem, it seems the functions are to be called with specific parameters.

content='Summary:\nThe task involves interpreting "move forward" in a room with specific coordinates. Given the ambiguity, the most plausible interpretation is moving towards an object that has a higher y-coordinate (assuming positive y is forward). The cucumber is located at (3.5, 1.5), which has a higher y-coordinate compared to the table at (3.5, 0.5). Therefore, the action involves moving to the cucumber\'s position.\n\nToolcall:\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_object",\n  "object_id": "cucumber_3"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if "forward" strictly means increasing the y-coordinate without changing x, then we should move to (0.0, 2.0). But given that objects are perceived and moving towards them is a common task, using `move_to_object` with cucumber seems more aligned with practical actions.\n\nBut reviewing initial interpretation again: if "forward" is purely along positive y-axis from current position without lateral movement, then correct toolcall would be to move to (0.0, 2.0).\n\nGiven problem\'s description and typical expectations, perhaps the simpler move forward is purely in y-direction:\n\nFinal toolcall would then be:\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_position",\n  "x": "0.0",\n  "y": "2.0"\n}\n```\n\nBut given that the perceived objects are not along x=0 but at x=3.5, and common tasks involve interacting with objects in sight, moving towards them seems more practical.\n\nThus likely intended answer is to move to cucumber (which is further forward in y than table):\n\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_object",\n  "object_id": "cucumber_3"\n}\n```\n\nBut since problem says: task is to give toolcalls arising from planned action where reasoning is "Move forward", and without more context, simplest interpretation of moving forward is along positive y-axis keeping x constant. Thus moving to (0.0,2.0).\n\nAlternatively if moving towards perceived objects is considered general \'forward\' movement in environment terms, then targeting closer object like cucumber or table.\n\nGiven no clear direction, both interpretations possible but likely more conventional to assume forward as +y in coordinate terms unless stated otherwise.\n\nThus most precise is move_to_position with forward in y:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_position": {"x": "0.0", "y": "2.0"}}\n```\n\nBut if we consider that in reality, when you move \'forward\' your path could be towards an object, and since the cucumber has higher y might be intended direction.\n\nGiven lack of explicit, and to align with common task structures where objects are targets for actions after movement, likely expectation is to use move_to_object.\n\nThus most probable correct toolcall:\n\n```json\n{"move_to_object": {"object_id": "cucumber_3"}}\n```\n\nBut to strictly follow coordinate-based forward (assuming positive y):\n\n```json\n{"move_to_position": {"x": "0.0", "y": "2.0"}}\n```\n\nGiven ambiguity, and that problem describes both movement functions with similar effect when object position is fixed, likely expects move_to_object based.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  "action": "move_to_object",\n  "object_id": "cucumber_3"\n}\n```' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3147, 'prompt_tokens': 1107, 'total_tokens': 4254, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'magistral:24b-small-2506-q8_0', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'id': 'chatcmpl-672', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--019aff6f-fdad-7521-9fbf-d3ca4fe2ea43-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1107, 'output_tokens': 3147, 'total_tokens': 4254, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}
