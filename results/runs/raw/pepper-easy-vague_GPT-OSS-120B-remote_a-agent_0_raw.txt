[reflector] **Facts after the executed move**

- The human is now at position (3.5, 1.0).
- Pepper_3 remains at (3.5, 1.5).
- Pepper_5 remains at (3.5, 1.0). *(Note: the human is now standing exactly where Pepper 5 is; the pepper is still on the floor.)*
- Pepper_4 remains at (3.0, 1.5).
- Table_6 is still at (3.5, 0.5) and is empty.
- Inventory is still empty.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

- The human is close enough to all three peppers to pick them up.
- Standing on (3.5, 1.0) does not automatically pick up Pepper 5; a separate “take” action will be needed.
- The table is reachable from the new position for dropping the peppers later.

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

- **Right:** The human is indeed within reach of Pepper 5 (they are co‑located) and also close to Pepper 3 and Pepper 4, so picking them up should be possible.
- **Wrong:** No automatic pickup occurred; the assumption that moving onto a pepper would add it to the inventory was incorrect. A distinct “take” action is still required.

- **Human position:** (3.5, 1.0) – unchanged.  
- **Inventory:** now contains **pepper_5**.

2. The human can still reach pepper_3 and pepper_4 to pick them up later.  
3. The table is still empty and available for dropping items.  

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

- **Right:**

  *Assumption 2* – the human remains at (3.5, 1.0) and is within reach of the other peppers.  
  *Assumption 3* – the table remains empty.

4. Other objects (pepper_3, pepper_4) are unaffected.  
5. The table can hold the object and is now non‑empty.

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

- **Assumption 1 – Right:** pepper_5 is now on table_6.  
- **Assumption 2 – Right:** pepper_5 is no longer in the inventory.  
- **Assumption 3 – Right:** human is still at (3.5, 0.5).  
- **Assumption 4 – Right:** pepper_3 and pepper_4 are unchanged.

[reflector] **Facts after the move (3.5, 0.5) → (3, 1.5)**  

- Human position: **(3, 1.5)**.  
- Inventory: **pepper_3** (the only item being carried).  
- **table_6** remains at **(3.5, 0.5)** and still **contains pepper_5**.  
- **pepper_4** is still **on the floor at (3.0, 1.5)** – the human now stands on the same tile as it.  
- No other objects changed.

**Assumptions made about the new state**

1. The *move* action only changes the human’s position; it does **not** automatically drop anything from the inventory.  
2. The *move* action does **not** automatically pick up objects that occupy the destination tile.  
3. The table’s contents stay unchanged during a move.  
4. The human can still later take pepper 4 because it is now co‑located.  

**Which assumptions proved right / wrong**

- **Assumption 1 – Right:** Inventory is still just pepper 3; nothing was dropped.  
- **Assumption 2 – Right:** Pepper 4 remains on the floor; it was not auto‑picked up.  
- **Assumption 3 – Right:** Table 6 still contains only pepper 5 and is untouched.  
- **Assumption 4 – Right:** Pepper 4 is reachable for a future “take” action.  

All expectations matched the observed state.

[reflector] **Facts after the action “take pepper_4”**

- **Human position:** (3.0, 1.5) – unchanged.  
- **Inventory:** now contains **pepper_3** *and* **pepper_4**.
