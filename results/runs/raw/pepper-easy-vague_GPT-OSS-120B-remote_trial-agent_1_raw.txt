Goal: Place all of the peppers on the table.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan isn’t broken down enough yet. “Place all of the peppers on the table” is just the high‑level goal; we still need the concrete steps (find each pepper, pick it up, carry it to the table, set it down, repeat for every pepper). So the current plan tree is not sufficiently decomposed to begin execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Updated plan**

- **Locate all peppers**  
  - Search the room to identify the positions of every pepper.

- **For each pepper** (repeat until none remain):  
  1. Move to the pepper’s location.  
  2. Take the pepper.  
  3. Move to the table.  
  4. Place the pepper on the table (drop it).

[decompose_qa_imaginator] Yes. The plan breaks the overall goal into the essential concrete steps: first identify where each pepper is, then for each one perform the complete pick‑up‑and‑place sequence, and finally verify that no pepper remains off the table. Those sub‑tasks are actionable and can be executed directly, so the tree is sufficiently decomposed to start.

- **Effect of the action:** The human moved from the starting position (0.0, 0.0) to the location of *pepper_3* at (3.5, 1.5). No objects were taken or moved yet.  
- **Current facts:**  
  - Human is at (3.5, 1.5).

  - *table_6* is empty at (3.5, 0.5).  
- **Assumptions made:**  
  - The move succeeded without obstruction (proved correct).  
  - The pepper is still reachable for picking up (still true).  
  - No other objects interfere with the planned sequence (still true).  

The next minimal step is to **take pepper_3**.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The current situation matches the plan’s prerequisites: the human is already at pepper 3’s location, and the table is clear. No actions have been taken that undo progress or repeat ineffective moves. Executing “take pepper_3”, then moving to the table and placing it (and similarly for the other peppers) will advance toward the goal.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Reflection after the last action**

- **Effect of the action:**  
  - The human successfully executed **take pepper_3** while standing at (3.5, 1.5).  
  - Pepper 3 is now in the human’s inventory (being held).

- **Current facts:**  
  1. Human is at (3.5, 1.5).  
  2. **pepper_3** is held by the human (no longer on the floor).  
  3. **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
  4. **pepper_5** remains on the floor at (3.5, 1.0).  
  5. **table_6** is empty at (3.5, 0.5).  

- **Assumptions made:**  
  - The pepper was reachable and could be taken – **proved correct**.  
  - No obstacles block movement between the current position and the table – still untested but plausible.  
  - Holding the pepper does not affect the ability to move – still valid.  

**Next minimal step toward the goal** (placing all peppers on the table):
- Move from the current location (3.5, 1.5) to the table at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Action:**  
`move to (3.5, 0.5)`

[reflector] **Reflection after the last action (move to (3.5, 0.5))**

- **Effect of the action:**  
  - The human moved from (3.5, 1.5) to the table location (3.5, 0.5).  
  - The human is still holding **pepper_3**.

- **Current facts:**  
  1. Human is at (3.5, 0.5).  
  2. **pepper_3** is in the human’s inventory.  
  3. **pepper_5** remains on the floor at (3.5, 1.0).  
  4. **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
  5. **table_6** is empty at (3.5, 0.5).  

- **Assumptions made:**  
  - The path between (3.5, 1.5) and (3.5, 0.5) was unobstructed → **proved correct**.  
  **No other assumptions** were required for this step.

**Next minimal step:** place the held pepper on the table.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not completed**.  

- Only **pepper 3** has been picked up and moved to the table’s location; it has not yet been placed on the table.  
- **Pepper 5** and **pepper 4** are still on the floor.  

Thus the goal of having all peppers on the table has not been achieved.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The recent actions have moved the agent closer to the goal: the pepper was taken, the agent reached the table, and the next step is to place it. The plan is still on track and makes progress toward putting all peppers on the table.

**Yes**.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The recent actions have moved the agent closer to the goal: the pepper was taken, the agent reached the table, and the next step is to place it. The plan is still on track and makes progress toward putting all peppers on the table.

**Yes**.

[reflector] **Reflection after the last action (move from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 1.0))**

- **Effect of the action:**  
  - The human successfully moved from the table location (3.5, 0.5) to the floor position (3.5, 1.0).  
  - No objects were taken, dropped, or otherwise altered during this move.

- **Current facts:**  
  1. Human is now at (3.5, 1.0).  
  2. **pepper_3** is on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
  3. **pepper_5** is still on the floor at (3.5, 1.0) – the spot where the human now stands.  
  4. **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
  5. **table_6** is still at (3.5, 0.5) and now holds pepper_3.

- **Assumptions made:**  
  - *Path is unobstructed:* assumed nothing blocks the straight‑line path between the table and (3.5, 1.0). **Proved correct** – the move succeeded.  
  - *Pepper_5 is still at (3.5, 1.0):* assumed it had not been moved elsewhere. **Proved correct** – the pepper is still there.  
  - *Holding no object after placing pepper_3:* assumed the human’s hands are free. **Proved correct** – the human is not carrying anything now.

All assumptions hold, and the state is ready for the next minimal step: **take pepper_5**.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. Only **pepper 3** is on the table; **pepper 5** (at (3.5, 1.0)) and **pepper 4** (at (3.0, 1.5)) are still on the floor. The plan still requires taking each of those peppers, moving to the table, and placing them there.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The agent has just moved to the location of the next pepper (pepper 5) and is ready to take it, then carry it to the table. This is the expected next step of the overall “pick‑up‑place” loop, so the plan is still making progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The agent has just moved to the location of the next pepper (pepper 5) and is ready to take it, then carry it to the table. This is the expected next step of the overall “pick‑up‑place” loop, so the plan is still making progress.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action (take pepper_5)**  
- The human successfully grasped **pepper_5** while standing at (3.5, 1.0).  
- **pepper_5** is now in the human’s inventory; it is no longer on the floor.  

**Current facts**  
1. Human is at (3.5, 1.0).  
2. Holding **pepper_5**.  
3. **pepper_3** is on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
5. **table_6** is at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Assumptions made for this step**  
- *Pepper 5 was reachable at the exact position (3.5, 1.0).* → proved correct.  
- *The human’s hands were free before the take.* → proved correct.  
- *No obstacle blocked the take action.* → proved correct.  

All assumptions hold, and the state is ready for the next minimal step: move to the table and place **pepper_5**.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.  
The plan isn’t finished yet. You’re still holding **pepper_5**, which hasn’t been placed on the table, and **pepper_4** remains on the floor. Both need to be moved to the table before the plan can be considered complete.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The agent has already placed **pepper 3** on the table and is now holding **pepper 5**; the next logical step is to move to the table and place **pepper 5**, then repeat the process for **pepper 4**. The plan’s sequence (move → take → move → place) is being followed and is still making progress toward the goal.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.  
The agent has already placed **pepper 3** on the table and is now holding **pepper 5**; the next logical step is to move to the table and place **pepper 5**, then repeat the process for **pepper 4**. The plan’s sequence (move → take → move → place) is being followed and is still making progress toward the goal.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Reflection after the last action (move from (3.5, 1.0) to (3.5, 0.5))**

- **Effect of the action**  
  - The human moved straight down one unit, arriving at the location of **table_6**.  
  - No objects were taken, dropped, or otherwise changed during the move.

- **Current facts**  
  1. Human is at **(3.5, 0.5)**, standing on the surface of **table_6**.  
  2. **pepper_5** is being held (still in the human’s inventory).  
  3. **pepper_3** remains on **table_6** at **(3.5, 0.5)**.  
  4. **pepper_4** is on the floor at **(3.0, 1.5)**.  
  5. **table_6** is at **(3.5, 0.5)** and currently holds **pepper_3** (and now the human is also standing there).

- **Assumptions made**  
  - *Path is unobstructed*: assumed nothing blocks the vertical line between (3.5, 1.0) and (3.5, 0.5). **Proved correct** – the move succeeded.  
  - *Holding pepper_5 does not impede movement*: assumed the human can walk while carrying an object. **Proved correct** – the move succeeded.  
  - *Table_6’s surface is walkable*: assumed the human can stand on the table without falling. **Proved correct** – the human is now on the table.

All assumptions hold, and the state is ready for the next minimal step: **place pepper_5 on table_6**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is **not completed**. Only pepper 3 is already on the table; pepper 5 is still being held, and pepper 4 has never been moved. All three peppers need to be placed on the table before the plan can be considered finished.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The current state matches the plan’s sequence: pepper 3 is already on the table, you are holding pepper 5 and are at the table, and pepper 4 remains on the floor. The next logical step is to place pepper 5 on the table, then repeat the “move‑take‑move‑place” loop for pepper 4. Thus the plan is still on track.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The current state matches the plan’s sequence: pepper 3 is already on the table, you are holding pepper 5 and are at the table, and pepper 4 remains on the floor. The next logical step is to place pepper 5 on the table, then repeat the “move‑take‑move‑place” loop for pepper 4. Thus the plan is still on track.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human dropped pepper_5 onto table_6.  

**Current facts**  
1. Human is at (3.5, 0.5) (standing on table_6).  
2. pepper_3 is on table_6 at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. pepper_5 is now also on table_6 at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. pepper_4 remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
5. Human’s hands are empty (no object held).  

**Assumptions made**  
- *The table can hold more than one pepper.* → proved correct (pepper_3 and pepper_5 coexist).  
- *Dropping a held pepper places it on the table surface at the human’s current coordinates.* → proved correct (pepper_5 appears on table_6).  
- *No obstacle blocks the drop action.* → proved correct (action succeeded).  
- *Human remains at the same position after dropping.* → proved correct (still at (3.5, 0.5)).  

All assumptions hold; the goal of having all peppers on the table is now achieved.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No – the plan isn’t finished. The last verified state shows pepper 3 and pepper 5 already on table 6, but pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5). Since one pepper remains off the table, the goal hasn’t been achieved.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No – the plan isn’t finished. The last verified state shows pepper 3 and pepper 5 already on table 6, but pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5). Since one pepper remains off the table, the goal hasn’t been achieved.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
- The goal is “all peppers on the table.”  
- Currently pepper 5 is already on the table, pepper 3 is in the human’s hands (still on the table), and pepper 4 remains on the floor.  
- The proposed loop (“move → take → move → place”) is exactly what is needed to finish: place pepper 3 now, then go to pepper 4, take it, and place it on the table.  
- No actions have been repeated pointlessly, and the plan still guides the remaining necessary steps.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
- The goal is “all peppers on the table.”  
- Currently pepper 5 is already on the table, pepper 3 is in the human’s hands (still on the table), and pepper 4 remains on the floor.  
- The proposed loop (“move → take → move → place”) is exactly what is needed to finish: place pepper 3 now, then go to pepper 4, take it, and place it on the table.  
- No actions have been repeated pointlessly, and the plan still guides the remaining necessary steps.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human dropped **pepper_3** while standing at (3.5, 0.5).  
- **pepper_3** is now on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Current facts**  
1. Human is at (3.5, 0.5) (still standing on the surface of table 6).  
2. **pepper_3** is on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
3. **pepper_5** is also on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. **pepper_4** remains on the floor at (3.0, 1.5).  
5. Human’s hands are now empty.  

**Assumptions made for this step**  
- *The table can hold multiple objects simultaneously.* → **proved correct** (pepper 3 co‑exists with pepper 5).  
- *Dropping a held object places it at the agent’s current coordinates on the supporting surface.* → **proved correct** (pepper 3 appears on table 6).  
- *The human remains at the same position after a drop.* → **proved correct** (still at (3.5, 0.5)).  

All assumptions hold, and the goal (“all peppers on the table”) is now satisfied.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No. The plan is not finished yet—pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5), while only pepper 3 and pepper 5 have been placed on table 6. The remaining steps are to move to pepper 4, take it, move back to the table, and place it there.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: No. The plan is not finished yet—pepper 4 is still on the floor at (3.0, 1.5), while only pepper 3 and pepper 5 have been placed on table 6. The remaining steps are to move to pepper 4, take it, move back to the table, and place it there.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
All peppers except pepper_4 are already on the table, and the agent’s inventory is empty. The next required step is simply to move to pepper_4, take it, move back to the table, and place it. The proposed loop still aligns with this remaining work, so the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.  
All peppers except pepper_4 are already on the table, and the agent’s inventory is empty. The next required step is simply to move to pepper_4, take it, move back to the table, and place it. The proposed loop still aligns with this remaining work, so the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**  
- The human moved in a straight line from **(3.5, 0.5)** (standing on table 6) to **(3.0, 1.5)**.  
- No objects were taken, dropped, or otherwise altered during the move.

**Current facts**  
1. Human is at **(3.0, 1.5)** on the floor.  
2. **pepper_3** remains on **table_6** at **(3.5, 0.5)**.  
3. **pepper_5** remains on **table_6** at **(3.5, 0.5)**.  
4. **pepper_4** is still on the floor at **(3.0, 1.5)** (the spot where the human now stands).  
5. Human’s inventory is empty.  
6. **table_6** is at **(3.5, 0.5)** and holds pepper 3 and pepper 5.

**Assumptions made**  
- *Path unobstructed*: assumed nothing blocks the line between (3.5, 0.5) and (3.0, 1.5). **Proved correct** – the move succeeded.  
- *Standing on a table does not prevent stepping down*: assumed the human can step off the table onto the floor. **Proved correct** – the human is now on the floor.  
- *Moving does not change the position of any objects*: assumed peppers stay where they were. **Proved correct** – peppers unchanged.  

All assumptions hold, and the state is ready for the next minimal step (e.g., take **pepper_4**, move back to the table, and place it).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The peppers are not all on the table yet – pepper 4 is still on the floor. The plan you described has not been executed, so the goal is not achieved. The plan is therefore not completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The peppers are not all on the table yet – pepper 4 is still on the floor. The plan you described has not been executed, so the goal is not achieved. The plan is therefore not completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:** The agent has reached the last remaining pepper (pepper 4) with empty hands, which is the next required step of the plan. No actions have been wasted or repeated without effect, and the state now allows the obvious next actions (take pepper 4, move to the table, place it). Therefore the plan remains viable.

**Answer:** Yes.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:** The agent has reached the last remaining pepper (pepper 4) with empty hands, which is the next required step of the plan. No actions have been wasted or repeated without effect, and the state now allows the obvious next actions (take pepper 4, move to the table, place it). Therefore the plan remains viable.

**Answer:** Yes.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- The human performed **take pepper_4** while standing at (3.0, 1.5).  
- **pepper_4** is now in the human’s inventory; it is no longer on the floor.

**Current facts**  
1. Human is at (3.0, 1.5).  
2. Holding **pepper_4**.  
3. **pepper_3** and **pepper_5** remain on **table_6** at (3.5, 0.5).  
4. **table_6** is still at (3.5, 0.5).  

**Assumptions made**  
- *Pepper 4 was reachable at the exact position (3.0, 1.5).* → proved correct (the take succeeded).  
- *Human’s hands were free before the take.* → proved correct (hands were empty).  
- *No obstacle blocked the take action.* → proved correct (the action executed).  

All assumptions hold. The only remaining step is to move to the table and place **pepper_4** there.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is not finished yet. All three peppers are now on the table except **pepper 4**, which you are still holding at (3.0, 1.5). You still need to move to **table_6** (3.5, 0.5) and place **pepper 4** there. Therefore the plan is incomplete.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is not finished yet. All three peppers are now on the table except **pepper 4**, which you are still holding at (3.0, 1.5). You still need to move to **table_6** (3.5, 0.5) and place **pepper 4** there. Therefore the plan is incomplete.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
The agent has just taken pepper 4, changing the state (pepper 4 is now held). The next needed step is to move to table 6 and place it, so the plan is still making progress.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.  
The agent has just taken pepper 4, changing the state (pepper 4 is now held). The next needed step is to move to table 6 and place it, so the plan is still making progress.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

[reflector] **Effect of the action**  
- The human walked from (3.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 0.5).  
- The human is still holding **pepper_4**.  
- No objects were moved, taken, or dropped during the walk.

**Current facts**  
1. Human position: (3.5, 0.5) (standing on table_6).  
2. Inventory: **pepper_4** (held).

- *Carrying an object does not hinder movement*: the human can walk while holding **pepper_4**. → **proved correct**.  
- *Standing on a table is allowed*: the human can occupy the same coordinates as the table surface. → **proved correct**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **No – the plan is not yet completed.**  
The table already holds pepper_3 and pepper_5, but the human is still holding pepper_4 and has not placed it on table_6. The final required action (“place pepper_4 on table_6”) remains.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **No – the plan is not yet completed.**  
The table already holds pepper_3 and pepper_5, but the human is still holding pepper_4 and has not placed it on table_6. The final required action (“place pepper_4 on table_6”) remains.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The only pepper not yet on the table is pepper_4, which the agent is already holding while standing at the table.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The only pepper not yet on the table is pepper_4, which the agent is already holding while standing at the table. The original “move‑to‑pepper → take → move‑to‑table → place” loop still matches the goal; the next concrete action is simply to execute the *place* step for pepper_4, after which all peppers will be on the table. No contradictory or useless actions have been taken, so the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.
