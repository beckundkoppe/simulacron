[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human moved from (0.0, 0.0) to the location of pepper_5, i.e. (3.5, 1.0).  
- No object was picked up or otherwise altered.  
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Current facts**

| Object | Position | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Human | (3.5, 1.0) | Not carrying anything |
| pepper_4 | (3.0, 1.5) | On the floor |
| pepper_3 | (3.5, 1.5) | On the floor |
| pepper_5 | (3.5, 1.0) | On the floor |
| table | (3.5, 0.5) | Empty |

**Assumptions made**

1. **Movement is possible** – the human can move to (3.5, 1.0) without obstruction.  
   *Proved true.* The action succeeded.

2. **No automatic pickup** – moving onto an object does not automatically pick it up.  
   *Proved true.* pepper_5 remains on the floor.

3. **No other objects moved** – the action only changes the human’s location.  
   *Proved true.* All peppers and the table stayed put.

4. **Human is not carrying anything** – since no “take” action was performed.  
   *Proved true.* The human’s inventory is empty.

These are the only changes and assumptions that hold after the action.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

- Human moved from (3.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5).  
- No objects were dropped or picked up during the move.

**Current facts**

| Object   | Position | Status                     |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|

**Assumptions made**

1. Movement to (3.5, 1.5) is possible.  
2. Moving onto a location with an object does not automatically pick it up.  
3. The human continues to carry the peppers already in inventory.  
4. No other objects change position or status.

Pepper_5 is removed from the table and placed in the human’s inventory; the table now holds only the other two peppers.

**Current facts**  
| Object   | Position | Status                     |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|
| Human    | (3.5, 0.5) | Carrying pepper_5          |
| pepper_5 | (3.5, 0.5) | On the table (removed)     |
| pepper_4 | (3.5, 0.5) | On the table               |
| pepper_3 | (3.5, 0.5) | On the table               |
| table    | (3.5, 0.5) | Contains pepper_4, pepper_3 |

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Picking up an object from a table removes it from the table and places it in the human’s inventory.  
2. The table can hold multiple objects.  
3. The human’s inventory updates immediately after the pick‑up.  
4. No other objects moved or changed status.

**Assumptions that proved right** – all four.  
**Assumptions that proved wrong** – none.

3. The human’s inventory updates immediately after the pick‑up.  
4. No other objects moved or changed state during the action.

**Assumptions that proved right** – all four.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**

The human moved to table_6 at (3.5, 0.5) and picked up **pepper_4**.

- No other objects moved or changed state.
