[reflector] **Effect of the executed action**

- The human agent has moved from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to the location of pepper 3.  
- The human’s current position is now at (3.0, 1.5).  
- Pepper 3 remains at (3.0, 1.5) (it has not been picked up).  
- Pepper 1 is still at (3.5, 1.5), pepper 2 at (3.5, 1.0).  
- The table remains at (3.5, 0.5).  
- No other objects or doors have changed state.

**Assumptions made and their validity**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The human can move to (3.0, 1.5) without obstruction. | **True** – the move succeeded. |
| Pepper 3 is located at (3.0, 1.5). | **True** – the human arrived at that exact coordinate. |
| No other objects were affected by the move. | **True** – only the human’s position changed. |

All assumptions that were required for the action were correct; no new facts were introduced beyond the human’s updated location.

2. No other objects moved or changed state during the move.

- Pepper 5 was removed from the human’s inventory and placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5).

| Table | (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper 3 and pepper 5 |

2. The table could accept another pepper.  
3. The drop action would succeed without obstruction.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the actions**  
- Pepper 3, 4 and 5 were placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5).  
- The human stayed on the table (still at (3.5, 0.5)).  
- The inventory became empty.

**Current facts**  
| Object | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human | (3.5, 0.5) |
| Table | (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper 3, 4, 5 |
| Pepper 3, 4, 5 | on table |
| Inventory | empty |

**Assumptions made**  
1. The table can hold multiple peppers.  
2. Each drop action succeeds without obstruction.  
3. The human’s inventory contained the peppers to be dropped.

**Assumptions proved right**  
All three assumptions held true; the drops succeeded and the table now holds all three peppers.

[reflector] **Effect of the actions**  
All three peppers (3, 4, 5) were placed on the table at (3.5, 0.5). The human remains standing on the table and the inventory becomes empty.

**Current facts**  
- Human: (3.5, 0.5)  
- Table: (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper 3, 4, 5  
- Pepper 3, 4, 5: on table  
- Inventory: empty  

**Assumptions made**  
1. The table can hold multiple peppers.  
2. Each drop action succeeds without obstruction.  
3. The human’s inventory contained the peppers to be dropped.

**Assumptions proved right**  
All three assumptions held true; the drops succeeded and the state matches the expected outcome.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the performed action**  
- Pepper 5 was removed from the room and placed into your inventory.  
- The table at (3.5, 0.5) still holds pepper 3 and pepper 4.  
- Your position remains (3.5, 0.5) in “main”.

**Updated facts**  
- **Human**: (3.5, 0.5)  
- **Table_6**: (3.5, 0.5), contains pepper 3 and pepper 4  
- **Pepper 5**: in inventory  
- **Inventory**: contains pepper 5  

**Assumptions made**  
1. Pepper 5 was present at (3.5, 0.5).  
2. The object could be collected (no obstruction).  
3. Your inventory can hold the pepper.

**Assumptions that proved right**  
All three assumptions held true; the state update matches the expected outcome.
