Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Spinach** was successfully collected from (1.5,3.0) and placed into **box_3** at (0.0,5.0).  
- **Lettuce** remains unprocessed; no actions were taken to move it to **shelf_4**.  

**Facts:**  
- Spinach locations (1.5,3.0), (3.5,4.5), (2.0,0.5) are valid.  
- Lettuce locations (0.5,2.5), (5.0,1.5), (2.5,3.5) are valid.  

**Assumptions:**  
- The task was completed after moving spinach.  
- Lettuce was not required to be moved (incorrect).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Spinach movement to box_3 was correct.  
- Lettuce’s unprocessed state was confirmed (task incomplete).  

**Conclusion:**  
The actions only addressed spinach. Lettuce must now be collected and placed into shelf_4 to fully complete the task.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Lettuce_10** (from (5.0,1.5)) was successfully placed into **shelf_4** at (5.0,5.0).  
- **Spinach** is already in **box_3**; no further action needed.  

**Facts:**

- **Lettuce** items remain at (0.5,2.5) and (2.5,3.5).

- Only one lettuce needed to be placed (incorrect).  
- Task is complete (incorrect).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- **Spinach movement to box_3 was correct** (proven right).  
- **Lettuce’s unprocessed state was confirmed** (proven right; task incomplete).  

**Wrong Assumptions:**  
- "Lettuce was not required to be moved" (proven wrong; all lettuce must be placed).  
- "Task was completed after moving spinach" (proven wrong; lettuce remains unprocessed).  

**Conclusion:**  
The task is **incomplete**. Two lettuce items remain unprocessed. All lettuce must be collected and placed into **shelf_4** to fully complete the goal.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Lettuce_9** (from (2.5,3.5)) was placed into **shelf_4**.  
- **Spinach_6** and **Spinach_7** remain unprocessed.  
- **Lettuce_8** (0.5,2.5) is still unprocessed.  

**Facts:**  
- **shelf_4** contains **lettuce_10** and **lettuce_9** (2 items); requires all lettuce.  
- **box_3** contains **spinach_5** (1 item); requires all spinach.  
- **Lettuce_8** remains at (0.5,2.5).  
- **Spinach_6** at (2.0,0.5) and **Spinach_7** at (3.5,4.5) remain unprocessed.  

**Assumptions About New State:**  
- "Only one lettuce needed to be placed" (proven **wrong**).  
- "Task is complete" (proven **wrong**).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Spinach movement to box_3 was correct (proven **right**).  
- Lettuce’s unprocessed state was confirmed (proven **right**).  

**Wrong Assumptions:**  
- "Task was completed after moving spinach" (proven **wrong**).  
- "Only one lettuce needed to be placed" (proven **wrong**).  

**Conclusion:**  
The task is **incomplete**. Remaining actions: collect **Lettuce_8** into **shelf_4**, and **Spinach_6**, **Spinach_7** into **box_3**.

[reflector] **Effect of Actions:**  
- **Spinach_7** was moved to **box_3** (0.0,5.0), completing spinach placement.  
- **Lettuce_10** was placed into **shelf_4** (5.0,5.0), confirming all lettuce is now in shelf_4.  

**Facts:**  
- **box_3** contains all spinach (**spinach_5**, **spinach_6**, **spinach_7**).  
- **shelf_4** contains all lettuce (**lettuce_8**, **lettuce_9**, **lettuce_10**).  
- **Tomato_12** and **pepper_14** remain irrelevant.  

**Assumptions About the New State:**  
- "Task is complete" (proven **right**).  
- "Only one spinach/lettuce needed" (proven **wrong**; all items required).  

**Proven Assumptions:**  
- Lettuce is fully processed (proven **right**).  
- Spinach movement to box_3 was correct (proven **right**).  

**Wrong Assumptions:**

- "Only one lettuce needed" (proven **wrong**; all lettuce required).
