Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:
- [365] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The current plan is just a single high‑level statement (“Sort the salad types…”) without any concrete sub‑steps. To execute the task the agent must know where the relevant objects are, how to pick them up, and where to place them. Therefore we need to decompose the goal into concrete actions such as locating the spinach, picking it up, moving to the box, putting it inside, then locating the lettuce, picking it up, moving to the shelf, and placing it there.

**Decision:** The plan tree is **not** sufficiently decomposed to start execution. It needs to be broken down into the detailed action sequence described above.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] The plan already breaks the overall goal down into concrete, atomic steps (move, take, drop) for each item and location, so there’s no further decomposition needed.  

**Answer:** Yes, the current plan tree is sufficiently decomposed to start execution.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the action**

- **New position:** The human is now at (1 × 1), i.e., standing on the same tile as *spinach_5*.
- **Inventory:** Still empty (no object has been taken yet).
- **Environment:** All items remain where they were; the box at (4, 1) and the shelf at (4, 3) are still empty.

**Assumptions made in the plan**

- *Assumption:* Moving to (1, 1) would place the agent next to a spinach item so it can be picked up next. **✔️ Proven right** – the agent is now on the same tile as *spinach_5*.
- *Assumption:* No obstacles prevent movement to (1, 1). **✔️ Proven right** – the move succeeded.
- *Assumption:* The agent’s inventory is empty, allowing a pick‑up action. **✔️ Still valid**.

No assumptions were disproved; the state matches expectations. Next steps: pick up *spinach_5* (and later the other spinach items), then carry them to the box, and similarly move the lettuce items to the shelf.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Yes.**  
We already know the exact locations of all spinach pieces, lettuce pieces, the box and the shelf, and the inventory is empty. The high‑level goal “put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf” can now be carried out directly by a sequence of primitive actions (move → take → drop). No further sub‑task decomposition is required.

Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Action sequence**

1. `take spinach_5`  
2. `move to (2,1)`  
3. `move to (3,1)`  
4. `move to (4,1)`   // at the box  
5. `drop spinach_5`   // puts it into the box  

6. `move to (3,1)`  
7. `take spinach_7`  
8. `move to (4,1)`  
9. `drop spinach_7`  

10. `move to (2,1)`  
11. `take spinach_6`  
12. `move to (4,1)`  
13. `drop spinach_6`   // all spinach now inside the box  

14. `move to (4,2)`  
15. `move to (4,3)`   // at the shelf  

16. `move to (3,3)`  
17. `take lettuce_10`  
18. `move to (4,3)`  
19. `drop lettuce_10`  

20. `move to (2,3)`  
21. `take lettuce_9`  
22. `move to (4,3)`  
23. `drop lettuce_9`  

24. `move to (1,3)`  
25. `take lettuce_8`  
26. `move to (4,3)`  
27. `drop lettuce_8`   // all lettuce now on the shelf  

**Result:** All spinach items are inside `box_3`; all lettuce items are on `shelf_4`. No other objects were moved.

| The inventory was empty. | ✔️ proved true (allowed pick‑up). |
| A pick‑up action can be performed on an object occupying the same tile. | ✔️ proved true (spinach_5 was collected). |
| No obstacle blocks picking up the item. | ✔️ proved true (action succeeded). |

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan is **not completed**.

- You are still holding *spinach_5* in your inventory; it has not been placed into the box yet.  
- The box at (4, 1) is empty.  
- The remaining spinach pieces (*spinach_6*, *spinach_7*) and all lettuce pieces are still on the floor, and the shelf at (4, 3) is empty.

Therefore the required actions of putting all spinach into the box and all lettuce onto the shelf have not been finished.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan is **not completed**.

- You are still holding *spinach_5* in your inventory; it has not been placed into the box yet.  
- The box at (4, 1) is empty.  
- The remaining spinach pieces (*spinach_6*, *spinach_7*) and all lettuce pieces are still on the floor, and the shelf at (4, 3) is empty.

Therefore the required actions of putting all spinach into the box and all lettuce onto the shelf have not been finished.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The agent has just picked up a spinach item, which is a necessary prerequisite for placing spinach into the box. No actions have been wasted or repeated, and the next logical step (moving to the box and dropping the spinach) is still feasible.  

**Answer:** yes.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (1.0,1.0) to (2,1)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action** – *move from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 1.0)*  

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 1.0) – you are now standing on the tile together with *spinach_6*. |
| **Inventory** | Still holds *spinach_5* (the first spinach you picked up). |
| **Environment** | • *spinach_5* is no longer on the floor (it is in your inventory).<br>• *spinach_6* remains on the floor at (2.0, 1.0) (now sharing the tile with you).<br>• *spinach_7* stays at (3.0, 1.0).<br>• All lettuce items are unchanged (lettuce_8 at (1.0, 3.0), lettuce_9 at (2.0, 3.0), lettuce_10 at (3.0, 3.0)).<br>• *box_3* is still empty at (4.0, 1.0).<br>• *shelf_4* is still empty at (4.0, 3.0). |

**Assumptions made before the move**

| Assumption | Was it correct? |
|------------|-----------------|
| The tile (2, 1) is reachable (no walls/doors blocking the path). | ✔️ Proven right – movement succeeded. |
| The tile (2, 1) is not occupied by an impassable object. | ✔️ Proven right – you could step onto the same tile as *spinach_6*. |
| Moving does not affect inventory contents. | ✔️ Proven right – *spinach_5* is still in inventory. |

All assumptions held; no new contradictions appear.  

**Next minimal steps toward the goal**

1. **Place the spinach you are carrying into the box** (`put spinach_5 in box_3`).  
2. **Pick up the remaining spinach items** (*spinach_6* then *spinach_7*) and deposit each in the box.  
3. **Move to the lettuce row (y = 3)** and, one by one, pick up each lettuce item and place it on the shelf (`shelf_4`).  

These actions will complete “put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf” with the smallest possible sequence.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The recent move to (2, 1) brought you closer to the box where the spinach should be placed, and you still have spinach_5 in your inventory. This is progress toward the next required step (“put spinach into the box”). Therefore the plan remains viable. **Yes**.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “move from (2.0, 1.0) to box_3”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 1.0) – you are now standing on the tile of *box_3*. |
| **Inventory** | Still holds *spinach_5* (the first spinach you picked up). |
| **Environment** | • *spinach_5* remains in your inventory (not on the floor).<br>• *spinach_6* is still at (2.0, 1.0).<br>• *spinach_7* is still at (3.0, 1.0).<br>• All lettuce items are unchanged at y = 3.<br>• *box_3* is still empty (you have not placed anything yet).<br>• *shelf_4* remains empty at (4.0, 3.0). |

**Assumptions made before the move**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Tile (4, 1) is reachable (no walls/doors blocking the path). | ✔️ Proven right – the move succeeded. |
| The tile (4, 1) is not occupied by an impassable object. | ✔️ Proven right – you could step onto the box’s location. |
| Moving does not affect the contents of the inventory. | ✔️ Proven right – *spinach_5* is still in inventory. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions appeared. The next minimal step is to **put *spinach_5* into *box_3***.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The box still contains no spinach, the inventory still holds *spinach_5*, and the other spinach and all lettuce items remain on the floor. Since the required action of putting the spinach into the box (and later the lettuce onto the shelf) has not been performed, the plan is not yet completed.

Reasoning: The box still contains no spinach, the inventory still holds *spinach_5*, and the other spinach and all lettuce items remain on the floor. Since the required action of putting the spinach into the box (and later the lettuce onto the shelf) has not been performed, the plan is not yet completed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent is now standing on the box `box_3` and is holding `spinach_5`. The next required step of the plan—placing the spinach into the box—can be executed immediately. No actions have been repeated without effect, and progress toward the goal is clear.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The agent is now standing on the box `box_3` and is holding `spinach_5`. The next required step of the plan—placing the spinach into the box—can be executed immediately. No actions have been repeated without effect, and progress toward the goal is clear.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “drop spinach_5 into box_3”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 1.0) – still standing on the tile of *box_3*. |
| **Inventory** | empty (the only item you were carrying, *spinach_5*, has been placed in the box). |
| **Box box_3** | now contains *spinach_5* (was empty before). |
| **Other objects** | *spinach_6* at (2.0, 1.0); *spinach_7* at (3.0, 1.0); lettuce_8, lettuce_9, lettuce_10 at y = 3; *shelf_4* at (4.0, 3.0) – all unchanged. |

**Assumptions made before the drop**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The agent is standing on the same tile as the container (*box_3*). | ✔️ proved true – the drop succeeded. |
| The box can accept the item (it is not full or locked). | ✔️ proved true – *spinach_5* was stored. |
| Dropping does not affect other objects or the agent’s position. | ✔️ proved true – only the inventory and box contents changed. |
| The agent’s inventory will be empty after the drop. | ✔️ proved true – inventory is now empty. |

All assumptions held; the world state after the action matches expectations.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **No, the plan is not completed.**  

Only *spinach_5* has been placed in the box. The other two spinach items (*spinach_6* and *spinach_7*) are still on the floor, and none of the lettuce items have been moved onto the shelf. To finish the goal you still need to collect the remaining spinach pieces and drop them into the box, then pick up each lettuce piece and put it onto the shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **No, the plan is not completed.**  

Only *spinach_5* has been placed in the box. The other two spinach items (*spinach_6* and *spinach_7*) are still on the floor, and none of the lettuce items have been moved onto the shelf. To finish the goal you still need to collect the remaining spinach pieces and drop them into the box, then pick up each lettuce piece and put it onto the shelf.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] Yes.  
We have already placed *spinach_5* into the box, and the box is now partially filled. The remaining tasks—putting *spinach_6* and *spinach_7* into the box and then moving the lettuce onto the shelf—are clear next steps, so the plan is still on track.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: Yes.  
We have already placed *spinach_5* into the box, and the box is now partially filled. The remaining tasks—putting *spinach_6* and *spinach_7* into the box and then moving the lettuce onto the shelf—are clear next steps, so the plan is still on track.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The goal requires **all** spinach objects to be inside `box_3` **and** all lettuce objects to be on `shelf_4`.  

- `box_3` currently holds only `spinach_5`. `spinach_6` and `spinach_7` are still on the floor and have not been moved to the box.  
- No lettuce items have been placed on `shelf_4` yet.  

Therefore the plan is **not** completed. Further actions are needed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The goal requires **all** spinach objects to be inside `box_3` **and** all lettuce objects to be on `shelf_4`.  

- `box_3` currently holds only `spinach_5`. `spinach_6` and `spinach_7` are still on the floor and have not been moved to the box.  
- No lettuce items have been placed on `shelf_4` yet.  

Therefore the plan is **not** completed. Further actions are needed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The box already holds *spinach_5*, but *spinach_6* and *spinach_7* are still outside. The agent is now on *spinach_7* with an empty inventory, so the next needed step is to pick it up and deposit it in the box. The plan “place spinach into the box” still has work to do and is moving toward the goal.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The box already holds *spinach_5*, but *spinach_6* and *spinach_7* are still outside. The agent is now on *spinach_7* with an empty inventory, so the next needed step is to pick it up and deposit it in the box. The plan “place spinach into the box” still has work to do and is moving toward the goal.

**Answer:** Yes.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “pick up spinach_7”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 1.0) – still standing on the same tile where *spinach_7* was. |
| **Inventory** | now contains *spinach_7* (the only item being carried). |
| **Environment** | • *spinach_7* is no longer on the floor (removed from (3, 1)).<br>• *spinach_6* remains at (2.0, 1.0).<br>• *spinach_5* is inside *box_3* at (4.0, 1.0).<br>• Lettuce items unchanged at y = 3.<br>• *box_3* still contains *spinach_5*; *shelf_4* is still empty. |

**Assumptions made before the pick‑up**

| Assumption | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| The agent’s inventory was empty, allowing a new item to be taken. | ✔️ proved true – the inventory accepted *spinach_7*. |
| An object on the same tile can be picked up. | ✔️ proved true – *spinach_7* was successfully collected. |
| No obstacle or rule prevents picking up this spinach (e.g., weight limit, lock). | ✔️ proved true – the action succeeded. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state now reflects that *spinach_7* is in the inventory, ready to be placed into the box.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The box currently holds only *spinach_5*.
- You are still carrying *spinach_7* and there is *spinach_6* on the floor.
- None of the three lettuce pieces have been placed on the shelf.

Therefore the goal “put all spinach into the box and all lettuce onto the shelf” is not yet achieved.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The box currently holds only *spinach_5*.
- You are still carrying *spinach_7* and there is *spinach_6* on the floor.
- None of the three lettuce pieces have been placed on the shelf.

Therefore the goal “put all spinach into the box and all lettuce onto the shelf” is not yet achieved.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
You have already stored *spinach 5* in the box and are now holding *spinach 7*. The next logical step is to drop *spinach 7* into the box, then retrieve *spinach 6* and store it as well, after which you can move to the lettuce row and place the lettuce on the shelf. Progress toward the goal is being made.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
You have already stored *spinach 5* in the box and are now holding *spinach 7*. The next logical step is to drop *spinach 7* into the box, then retrieve *spinach 6* and store it as well, after which you can move to the lettuce row and place the lettuce on the shelf. Progress toward the goal is being made.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

The goal is to have **all spinach** in *box_3* and **all lettuce** on *shelf_4*.  

Current state:

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| *spinach_5* | inside *box_3* (already placed) |
| *spinach_7* | in your inventory (not yet in the box) |
| *spinach_6* | on the floor at (2.0, 1.0) (not yet collected) |
| Lettuce pieces (*lettuce_8*, *lettuce_9*, *lettuce_10*) | on the floor at y = 3 (not yet on the shelf) |
| *box_3* | at (4.0, 1.0) |
| *shelf_4* | empty at (4.0, 3.0) |

Only one spinach item has been put into the box, and none of the lettuce have been moved to the shelf. Therefore the plan “place spinach into the box (and consequently sort lettuce onto the shelf)” is **not yet completed**.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed. Further actions are needed to deposit the remaining spinach (*spinach_7* and *spinach_6*) into the box and to move each lettuce piece onto the shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

The goal is to have **all spinach** in *box_3* and **all lettuce** on *shelf_4*.  

Current state:

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| *spinach_5* | inside *box_3* (already placed) |
| *spinach_7* | in your inventory (not yet in the box) |
| *spinach_6* | on the floor at (2.0, 1.0) (not yet collected) |
| Lettuce pieces (*lettuce_8*, *lettuce_9*, *lettuce_10*) | on the floor at y = 3 (not yet on the shelf) |
| *box_3* | at (4.0, 1.0) |
| *shelf_4* | empty at (4.0, 3.0) |

Only one spinach item has been put into the box, and none of the lettuce have been moved to the shelf. Therefore the plan “place spinach into the box (and consequently sort lettuce onto the shelf)” is **not yet completed**.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed. Further actions are needed to deposit the remaining spinach (*spinach_7* and *spinach_6*) into the box and to move each lettuce piece onto the shelf.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
You have already stored *spinach 5* in the box and are now carrying *spinach 7* to the same container. The next obvious step – dropping *spinach 7* (and later *spinach 6*) into the box – continues the plan of “put all spinach into the box” before moving on to the lettuce‑to‑shelf part. No action has been repeated without effect, so the plan remains on track.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
You have already stored *spinach 5* in the box and are now carrying *spinach 7* to the same container. The next obvious step – dropping *spinach 7* (and later *spinach 6*) into the box – continues the plan of “put all spinach into the box” before moving on to the lettuce‑to‑shelf part. No action has been repeated without effect, so the plan remains on track.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped spinach_7 into box_3
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “drop spinach_7 into box_3”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 1.0) – still standing on the tile of *box_3*. |
| **Inventory** | empty (the only carried item, *spinach_7*, has been stored). |
| **Box *box_3*** | now contains **spinach_5** (already there) **and spinach_7** (just added). |
| **Other spinach** | *spinach_6* remains at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Lettuce items** | *lettuce_8* (1.0, 3.0), *lettuce_9* (2.0, 3.0), *lettuce_10* (3.0, 3.0). |
| **Shelf *shelf_4*** | still empty at (4.0, 3.0). |

**Assumptions made before the drop**

1. **The agent is standing on the same tile as the container** – true (agent on *box_3*).  
2. **The box can accept another item (it is not full or locked)** – true; *spinach_7* was stored.  
3. **Dropping an item only changes the inventory and the container’s contents** – true; no other objects moved or changed.  
4. **After dropping, the inventory becomes empty** – true.

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state now reflects that the box holds both spinach pieces, while the shelf is still empty and the lettuce remains untouched.

[observer] **Observation**

- **Position:** (4.0, 1.0) – standing on the tile of *box_3*.  
- **Inventory:** empty (no items carried).  
- **Box *box_3*:** now **contains 2 items** – *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* (previously it held only *spinach_5*).  
- **Spinach:** *spinach_6* remains on the floor at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **Lettuce:** *lettuce_8* (1.0, 3.0), *lettuce_9* (2.0, 3.0), *lettuce_10* (3.0, 3.0) – unchanged.  
- **Shelf *shelf_4*:** still empty at (4.0, 3.0).  

No other facts have changed. The next minimal step is to pick up a lettuce item and place it on the shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer: No, the plan is not yet completed.**

**Reasoning**

- The required goal is two‑fold:  
  1. **All spinach items** must be stored in *box_3*.  
  2. **All lettuce items** must be placed on *shelf_4*.

- **Current state** (after the last action):  
  - *box_3* (at 4, 1) contains **spinach_5** and **spinach_7** – the spinach goal is satisfied (the remaining spinach 6 is still on the floor, but it has not yet been moved into the box).  
  - *shelf_4* (at 4, 3) is still **empty**.  
  - Lettuce pieces **lettuce_8**, **lettuce_9**, **lettuce_10** remain on the floor at row y = 3; none have been transferred to the shelf.

- Since **no lettuce has been picked up or dropped onto the shelf**, the second part of the goal is still unmet.

Therefore, the overall plan (sorting the salad types) is only half‑done; you still need to move each lettuce piece to the shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer: No, the plan is not yet completed.**

**Reasoning**

- The required goal is two‑fold:  
  1. **All spinach items** must be stored in *box_3*.  
  2. **All lettuce items** must be placed on *shelf_4*.

- **Current state** (after the last action):  
  - *box_3* (at 4, 1) contains **spinach_5** and **spinach_7** – the spinach goal is satisfied (the remaining spinach 6 is still on the floor, but it has not yet been moved into the box).  
  - *shelf_4* (at 4, 3) is still **empty**.  
  - Lettuce pieces **lettuce_8**, **lettuce_9**, **lettuce_10** remain on the floor at row y = 3; none have been transferred to the shelf.

- Since **no lettuce has been picked up or dropped onto the shelf**, the second part of the goal is still unmet.

Therefore, the overall plan (sorting the salad types) is only half‑done; you still need to move each lettuce piece to the shelf.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:** All spinach items (spinach 5 and 7) are already inside box 3, and the only remaining goal is to move lettuce onto shelf 4. Re‑issuing the plan “place spinach into the box” would repeat an already‑completed step and produce no state change.

**Answer:** No.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:** All spinach items (spinach 5 and 7) are already inside box 3, and the only remaining goal is to move lettuce onto shelf 4. Re‑issuing the plan “place spinach into the box” would repeat an already‑completed step and produce no state change.

**Answer:** No.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **No.**  
The plan tree still consists of a single high‑level node – “Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.”  
To start executing we must first decompose this goal into concrete sub‑tasks that the agent can act on, e.g.:

1. **Spinach**
   - Pick up *spinach_6* (at 2, 1).
   - Move to *box_3* (4, 1) and drop *spinach_6*.

2. **Lettuce** (repeat for each piece)
   - Move to *lettuce_8* (1, 3), pick it up, move to *shelf_4* (4, 3), drop it.
   - Move to *lettuce_9* (2, 3), pick it up, move to *shelf_4*, drop it.
   - Move to *lettuce_10* (3, 3), pick it up, move to *shelf_4*, drop it.

Only after this decomposition into actionable steps (pick‑up, move, put‑down) is the plan tree ready for execution.

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Current world state**  

| Item | Location / Status |
|------|-------------------|
| **box_3** (4, 1) | contains *spinach_5* & *spinach_7* |
| **spinach_6** (2, 1) | on the floor, not yet stored |
| **shelf_4** (4, 3) | empty |

| **Agent** (4, 1) | inventory empty |

**Goal** – All spinach → **box_3**; all lettuce → **shelf_4**.  
Only *spinach_6* remains to be stored; all three lettuce pieces must be moved to the shelf.

## Refined plan tree

```
[375]  Goal: put all spinach in the box and all lettuce on the shelf
│
├─[380]  Store remaining spinach
│   ├─[381]  Move to (2, 1)                ← from (4, 1) left‑left
│   ├─[382]  Pick up spinach_6
│   ├─[383]  Move to (4, 1)                ← right‑right back to the box
│   └─[384]  Put spinach_6 in box_3
│
└─[390]  Store lettuce (repeat for each lettuce_i)
    ├─[391]  Move to lettuce_i   (i = 8,9,10)  ← walk from (4, 1) to (x_i, 3)
    ├─[392]  Pick up lettuce_i
    ├─[393]  Move to (4, 3)      (shelf_4)
    └─[394]  Put lettuce_i on shelf_4
```

### How the refined nodes map to concrete actions

| Node | Concrete action (in world‑coordinates) |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| **381** | `move (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1)` |
| **382** | `pick up spinach_6` |
| **383** | `move (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1)` |
| **384** | `put spinach_6 in box_3` |
| **391‑394** (repeat three times) | 1. `move` from current location to lettuce_i’s tile (e.g., (1,3) for lettuce_8). <br>2. `pick up lettuce_i`. <br>3. `move` to shelf tile (4,3). <br>4. `put lettuce_i on shelf_4`. |
| **Sequence** | After finishing **384**, the agent is at (4,1). The first lettuce loop starts by moving north‑east to lettuce_8 at (1,3), then repeats for lettuce_9 and lettuce_10. |

### Why this refinement is minimal and safe

* **All pre‑conditions are satisfied** – each move goes through free tiles, each pick‑up is performed on the same tile as the object, each put‑in is performed while standing on the container’s tile.
* **No unnecessary detours** – the agent returns to the box only once (after collecting the last spinach) and then proceeds directly to each lettuce, ending on the shelf.
* **Deterministic ordering** – spinach is completed first, guaranteeing the box is “full” before we start using the shelf, which avoids any accidental mixing of types.
* **Loop is explicit** – the three lettuce sub‑tasks are clearly enumerated, making it easy for the executor to track progress and stop once all lettuce are on the shelf.

---

### Next execution step

Begin with **[381]**: *move from (4, 1) to (2, 1).* Once that succeeds, continue down the refined branch. This will finish the salad‑sorting task in the smallest number of actions.

    └─[394]  Put lettuce_i on shelf_4
```

### How the refined nodes map to concrete actions

| Node | Concrete action (in world‑coordinates) |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| **381** | `move (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1)` |
| **382** | `pick up spinach_6` |
| **383** | `move (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1)` |
| **384** | `put spinach_6 in box_3` |
| **391‑394** (repeat three times) | 1. `move` from current location to lettuce_i’s tile (e.g., (1,3) for lettuce_8). <br>2. `pick up lettuce_i`. <br>3. `move` to shelf tile (4,3). <br>4. `put lettuce_i on shelf_4`. |
| **Sequence** | After finishing **384**, the agent is at (4,1). The first lettuce loop starts by moving north‑east to lettuce_8 at (1,3), then repeats for lettuce_9 and lettuce_10. |

### Why this refinement is minimal and safe

* **All pre‑conditions are satisfied** – each move goes through free tiles, each pick‑up is performed on the same tile as the object, each put‑in is performed while standing on the container’s tile.
* **No unnecessary detours** – the agent returns to the box only once (after collecting the last spinach) and then proceeds directly to each lettuce, ending on the shelf.
* **Deterministic ordering** – spinach is completed first, guaranteeing the box is “full” before we start using the shelf, which avoids any accidental mixing of types.
* **Loop is explicit** – the three lettuce sub‑tasks are clearly enumerated, making it easy for the executor to track progress and stop once all lettuce are on the shelf.

---

### Next execution step

Begin with **[381]**: *move from (4, 1) to (2, 1).* Once that succeeds, continue down the refined branch. This will finish the salad‑sorting task in the smallest number of actions.

Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:
- [375] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf. (current focus)
  - [376] Store remaining spinach
  - [377] Store lettuce (repeat for each lettuce_i)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer: Yes – the plan is already broken down enough to begin acting.**  

**Why it’s sufficient**

1. **Goal → Two concrete branches**  
   * *Store remaining spinach* – there is only one spinach left on the floor (*spinach_6*). The branch implicitly contains the two primitive steps needed to finish it:  
   – move to the tile of *spinach_6* (if not already there)  
   – pick it up and drop it into *box_3*.  

2. **Goal → Store lettuce (repeat for each lettuce_i)** – the “repeat for each lettuce_i” clause already enumerates three identical, atomic sub‑tasks:  
   – go to *lettuce_8*, pick it up, place it on *shelf_4*  
   – go to *lettuce_9*, pick it up, place it on *shelf_4*  
   – go to *lettuce_10*, pick it up, place it on *shelf_4*  

   No further hierarchical decomposition (e.g., “open shelf”, “check capacity”) is required because the environment guarantees that the shelf can accept items and there are no obstacles.

3. **All primitives are executable now**  
   * The agent is already at the box, the box is empty enough, and the shelf is empty.  
   * The only remaining floor object is *spinach_6* at (2, 1), which can be reached directly.  
   * Lettuce items are all reachable (no walls/doors reported).  

Since each branch corresponds to a small, well‑defined sequence of primitive actions that can be carried out immediately, the plan tree is *sufficiently decomposed* to start execution. The next steps are simply to follow the two branches in order:

1. **Store remaining spinach** → pick up *spinach_6* and drop it into *box_3*.  
2. **Store lettuce (repeat)** → for each lettuce item, pick it up and drop it on *shelf_4*.

No further refinement is needed before beginning.

  - [376] Store remaining spinach
  - [377] Store lettuce (repeat for each lettuce_i)

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] **Selected leaf task:** **[376] Store remaining spinach**

**Justification:**  
All spinach items must end up in the box. The box already holds *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*, but *spinach_6* is still on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). Completing task [376] (picking up *spinach_6* and dropping it into *box_3*) will finish the spinach‑sorting part of the goal, after which we can move on to storing the lettuce items. This is the immediate next step required to achieve the overall objective.

[observer] **Observation**  

- **Position** – you are at (4.0, 1.0), standing on the tile of *box_3*.  
- **Inventory** – empty.  
- **Box box_3** – contains exactly two items: *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* (no change since the last drop).  
- **Shelf shelf_4** – still empty.  
- **Spinach** – *spinach_6* remains on the floor at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **Lettuce** – *lettuce_8* at (1.0, 3.0), *lettuce_9* at (2.0, 3.0), *lettuce_10* at (3.0, 3.0).  

No new objects or state changes have appeared. The world state matches the expected facts, confirming that the box now holds all spinach items and the shelf is ready for lettuce.

Plan:
Store remaining spinach
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve – step‑by‑step plan (only actions you can do yourself)**  

1. **Go to the last spinach** – walk from the box to the tile where *spinach_6* is lying.  
   * From (4, 1) → step west to (3, 1)  
   * From (3, 1) → step west to (2, 1) – now you are standing on *spinach_6*.

2. **Pick it up** – execute the *pick‑up* action on the object that is on the same tile.  
   * `pick up spinach_6` → the spinach is removed from the floor and placed in your inventory.

3. **Return to the box** – walk back to the box’s location.  
   * From (2, 1) → step east to (3, 1)  
   * From (3, 1) → step east to (4, 1) – you are now standing on **box_3** again.

4. **Store the spinach in the box** – drop the item you are carrying into the container.  
   * `drop spinach_6 in box_3`

After these four simple actions the box will contain **spinach_5, spinach_7, and spinach_6** – i.e. *all* the spinach is stored, satisfying the “store remaining spinach” part of the overall goal.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The box already holds the two spinach items you collected, but **spinach 6** is still lying on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). The plan calls for storing the remaining spinach, which would require picking it up and putting it away (e.g., in the box). Since that step hasn’t been performed, the plan is **not completed**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The box already holds the two spinach items you collected, but **spinach 6** is still lying on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). The plan calls for storing the remaining spinach, which would require picking it up and putting it away (e.g., in the box). Since that step hasn’t been performed, the plan is **not completed**.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The agent has already stored spinach 5 and spinach 7, but spinach 6 is still on the floor. The current actions have only moved the agent around; they haven’t yet addressed spinach 6, so the goal of “store remaining spinach” is still unmet but still achievable. Hence the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The agent has already stored spinach 5 and spinach 7, but spinach 6 is still on the floor. The current actions have only moved the agent around; they haven’t yet addressed spinach 6, so the goal of “store remaining spinach” is still unmet but still achievable. Hence the plan remains promising.  

**Answer: yes**

Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer: No – the plan is not yet ready for execution.**

**Reasoning**

The current plan tree contains only a single high‑level node:

* [378] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.*

All spinach has already been placed in the box, but the lettuce items are still on the floor and the shelf is empty. To turn the goal into executable actions we still need to break it down into concrete sub‑steps, e.g.:

1. **For each lettuce item**  
   a. Move to its location ( (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3) ).  
   b. Pick it up.  
   c. Move to the shelf location ( (4, 3) ).  
   d. Drop the lettuce onto the shelf.

Only after this decomposition do we have a sequence of primitive actions (move, pick‑up, drop) that the agent can start performing. Therefore the plan tree must be further expanded before execution can begin.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] **Selected leaf task: [379] move from (3, 1) to (3, 3)**  

*Justification:* The agent is currently at (3, 1) with an empty inventory, while the first lettuce item (lettuce_10) that needs to be sorted is located at (3, 3). Moving to that tile is the prerequisite for picking up lettuce_10 and continuing the plan to place all lettuce on the shelf. This makes [379] the most immediate and necessary next action.

[observer] **Observation (current state at (3.0, 1.0))**

- **Position:** (3.0, 1.0) – the tile contains no object (not listed in perception).  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **Nearby objects (from perception):**  
  – *spinach_6* at (2.0, 1.0)  
  – *box_3* at (4.0, 1.0) containing *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*  
  – *shelf_4* at (4.0, 3.0) – empty  
  – Lettuce items at y = 3: *lettuce_8* (1.0, 3.0), *lettuce_9* (2.0, 3.0), *lettuce_10* (3.0, 3.0)  
- **New discovery for the planned move (3, 1) → (3, 3):** the intermediate tile (3.0, 2.0) is not occupied by any listed object, so the vertical path is clear.

Plan:
move from (3,1) to (3,3)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naive (step‑by‑step) plan**

1. `move from (3.0, 1.0) to (3.0, 2.0)`  
2. `move from (3.0, 2.0) to (3.0, 3.0)`

These two elementary moves will carry the agent from its current tile (3, 1) up to the target tile (3, 3) while respecting the one‑step‑per‑action rule.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “move from (3.0, 1.0) to (3.0, 2.0)”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 2.0) – now standing on the tile directly north of the previous spot. |
| **Inventory** | still empty (no items have been picked up or dropped). |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged – still at (4.0, 1.0) and contains *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Spinach** | *spinach_6* remains at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Lettuce** | *lettuce_8* (1.0, 3.0), *lettuce_9* (2.0, 3.0), *lettuce_10* (3.0, 3.0). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | unchanged – empty at (4.0, 3.0). |
| **Tile (3, 2)** | observed to be empty (no object occupies it). |

### Assumptions made before the move

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| **(3, 2) is reachable** – there are no walls, doors, or other impassable obstacles blocking the north‑ward step. | ✅ **Proved true** – the agent moved successfully onto (3, 2). |
| **The tile (3, 2) can be occupied together with the floor (i.e., it is not a container or a forbidden space).** | ✅ **Proved true** – the agent stands there without issue. |
| **Moving does not change inventory or any container contents.** | ✅ **Proved true** – inventory stays empty; box and shelf unchanged. |
| **No other objects are displaced by the movement.** | ✅ **Proved true** – all objects remain where they were. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions emerged. The world state after the move matches the expected facts.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] No.  
The agent has moved from (3,1) to (3,2), but it has not yet reached the target square (3,3). The second northward step is still pending. Hence the plan is not completed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent has just moved from (3,1) to (3,2), confirming the path is clear and making concrete progress toward the intended north‑ward move to (3,3). No obstacles were encountered, and the state has changed (the agent’s position advanced one step).

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The agent has just moved from (3,1) to (3,2), confirming the path is clear and making concrete progress toward the intended north‑ward move to (3,3). No obstacles were encountered, and the state has changed (the agent’s position advanced one step).

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

### Assumptions made before the move

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| 1. Tile (3, 3) is reachable – no walls, doors or other impassable objects block the north‑ward step from (3, 2). | **✔︎ proved true** – the move succeeded. |
| 2. The tile can be occupied together with a lettuce object (objects of type *lettuce* are not collidable). | **✔︎ proved true** – the agent stands on the same square as *lettuce_10*. |
| 3. Moving does not alter inventory or any container contents. | **✔︎ proved true** – inventory stays empty; box and shelf unchanged. |
| 4. No other objects are displaced by the movement. | **✔︎ proved true** – all other objects remain where they were. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state now matches the expected facts, positioning the agent ready to pick up *lettuce_10* (or any other lettuce) for the next step.

[observer] **Observation (current state at (3.0, 3.0))**

- **Position:** You are at **(3.0, 3.0)** in room *main*.
- **Inventory:** empty.
- **Lettuce:** *lettuce_10* is on the same tile as you (position (3.0, 3.0)). The other lettuces remain at (1.0, 3.0) (*lettuce_8*) and (2.0, 3.0) (*lettuce_9*).
- **Spinach:** *spinach_6* is at (2.0, 1.0). *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* are inside *box_3* at (4.0, 1.0).
- **Shelf:** *shelf_4* at (4.0, 3.0) is still empty.
- **Box:** *box_3* at (4.0, 1.0) contains exactly two items (*spinach_5*, *spinach_7*).

**New discovery:** The north‑ward path from (3, 1) to (3, 3) was clear; you have successfully reached the target tile (3, 3) without encountering any obstacles. This fulfills the planned move.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The agent has already arrived at (3, 3) (the latest observation shows the position (3.0, 3.0)). Since the intended movement from (3, 1) to (3, 3) has been performed without any obstacles, the plan is finished.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The agent has already arrived at (3, 3) (the latest observation shows the position (3.0, 3.0)). Since the intended movement from (3, 1) to (3, 3) has been performed without any obstacles, the plan is finished.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
pick up lettuce_10
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve (single‑step) solution**

The human is already standing on the tile that contains **lettuce_10** (position (3.0, 3.0)) and the inventory is empty, so the only action needed is the direct “pick‑up” command.

```
pick up lettuce_10
```

Executing this action will move *lettuce_10* from the floor into the agent’s inventory, completing the plan in one simple step. No intermediate moves, drops, or container interactions are required.

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “pick up lettuce_10”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 3.0) – still standing on the tile where *lettuce_10* was. |
| **Inventory** | now contains *lettuce_10* (the only item being carried). |

### Assumptions made before the pick‑up

| Assumption | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| The agent’s inventory was empty, allowing a new item to be taken. | ✔️ **proved true** – inventory accepted *lettuce_10*. |
| An object on the same tile can be picked up (lettuce is pick‑up‑able). | ✔️ **proved true** – *lettuce_10* was successfully collected. |
| No rule (weight limit, lock, etc.) prevents picking up this lettuce. | ✔️ **proved true** – the action succeeded. |
| Picking up does not affect any other objects or containers. | ✔️ **proved true** – all other items stayed where they were. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose.

### Updated world state (summary)

* **Agent:** at (3.0, 3.0) holding *lettuce_10*.  
* **Box box_3 (4, 1):** contains *spinach_5* & *spinach_7*.  
* **Shelf shelf_4 (4, 3):** empty.  
* **Spinach 6:** on floor at (2, 1).  
* **Lettuce 8 & 9:** at (1, 3) and (2, 3) respectively.  

The next minimal step will be to transport *lettuce_10* to the shelf at (4, 3).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The last state update shows the agent’s inventory **contains lettuce_10**, and the lettuce is no longer on the floor. Since the plan’s sole goal was to pick up lettuce_10—and that action has already succeeded—the plan is finished.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The last state update shows the agent’s inventory **contains lettuce_10**, and the lettuce is no longer on the floor. Since the plan’s sole goal was to pick up lettuce_10—and that action has already succeeded—the plan is finished.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “move from (3.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 3.0)”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – you are now standing on the tile that holds *shelf_4*. |
| **Inventory** | still contains *lettuce_10* (the only item you are carrying). |
| **Shelf *shelf_4*** | unchanged – still empty, but now the agent is co‑located with it (standing on the shelf’s tile). |
| **Box *box_3*** | unchanged – at (4.0, 1.0) containing *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Spinach *spinach_6*** | unchanged – on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_8*** | at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_9*** | at (2.0, 3.0). |
| **Other tiles** | No new objects appeared; all other world facts remain as before. |

---

### Assumptions made before the move  

| Assumption | Verdict (proved?) |
|------------|--------------------|
| (4, 3) is reachable – no walls, doors or other impassable obstacles block the east‑ward step from (3, 3). | ✅ proved true – the move succeeded. |
| The tile can be occupied together with a shelf (the shelf is not a solid barrier). | ✅ proved true – the agent stands on the same square as *shelf_4*. |
| Moving does not change the inventory or the contents of any container. | ✅ proved true – *lettuce_10* is still in the inventory; *box_3* and *shelf_4* contents are unchanged. |
| No other objects are displaced by the movement. | ✅ proved true – all other items remain at their previous coordinates. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state after the move matches the expected facts, setting you up to place *lettuce_10* onto *shelf_4* in the next minimal step.

Plan:
drop lettuce_10 on shelf_4
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naive (single‑step) plan**

Since the agent is already standing on the tile that contains **shelf_4** (position (4.0, 3.0)) and the inventory holds **lettuce_10**, the whole task can be completed with one primitive action:

```
drop lettuce_10 on shelf_4
```

*Pre‑conditions that are already satisfied*  

1. **Agent position** = (4, 3) – the same tile as *shelf_4*.  
2. **Inventory** contains *lettuce_10*.  

*Effect of the action*  

- *lettuce_10* is removed from the inventory.  
- *lettuce_10* becomes an item placed on *shelf_4*.  

That single command is the simplest way for a human (or the agent) to achieve “put the lettuce on the shelf.” No additional moves or intermediate actions are required.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped lettuce_10 into shelf_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “drop lettuce_10 into shelf_4”**

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – unchanged (still standing on the tile that holds *shelf_4*). |
| **Inventory** | empty – the only carried item (*lettuce_10*) has been placed in the shelf. |
| **Shelf *shelf_4*** | now **contains** *lettuce_10* (it was empty before). |
| **Box *box_3*** | still at (4.0, 1.0) with *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* inside. |
| **Spinach *spinach_6*** | unchanged – on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_8*** | at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_9*** | at (2.0, 3.0). |
| **Other tiles** | no new objects appeared; all other facts remain as before. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the drop

| Assumption | Verdict (proved?) |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1. The agent’s inventory held exactly one item (*lettuce_10*) and was therefore able to drop it. | ✅ proved true – inventory became empty. |
| 2. *shelf_4* can accept a lettuce item (i.e., it is a container that is not full). | ✅ proved true – *lettuce_10* is now inside the shelf. |
| 3. Dropping an item does **not** move the agent or affect any other object. | ✅ proved true – position and all other objects stayed the same. |
| 4. No hidden rule (weight limit, lock, etc.) blocks dropping lettuce onto the shelf. | ✅ proved true – the action succeeded without error. |
| 5. After the drop the world state remains consistent (no contradictions such as “lettuce_10 on the floor and in the shelf”). | ✅ proved true – the lettuce now only appears inside the shelf. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world is now in the desired configuration: **all spinach items are stored in *box_3* and all lettuce items are stored in *shelf_4*** (lettuce_8 and lettuce_9 remain on the floor, lettuce_10 now on the shelf).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The current world state shows the agent standing at (4.0, 3.0) with an **empty inventory**.  
- **Shelf shelf_4** (located at (4.0, 3.0)) now **contains lettuce_10** (its contents count is 1).  
- No other changes occurred, and the drop action was reported as successful.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The current world state shows the agent standing at (4.0, 3.0) with an **empty inventory**.  
- **Shelf shelf_4** (located at (4.0, 3.0)) now **contains lettuce_10** (its contents count is 1).  
- No other changes occurred, and the drop action was reported as successful.

Since the intended outcome—*lettuce_10* placed on *shelf_4*—has been achieved, the plan is finished.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan has been completed.

1. **move west** – step from **(4, 3)** to **(3, 3)**.  
2. **move west** – step from **(3, 3)** to **(2, 3)**.  

These two ordinary “move” actions will place the agent at the target tile (2, 3).

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,3.0) to (3,3)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “move from (4.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 3.0)”**

| Fact | Value after the move |
|------|----------------------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 3.0) – the agent is now standing on the tile that used to hold *lettuce_10* on the floor (the lettuce is no longer there). |
| **Inventory** | empty (unchanged). |
| **Shelf *shelf_4*** | still at (4.0, 3.0) and still **contains** *lettuce_10*. |
| **Box *box_3*** | unchanged – at (4.0, 1.0) with *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Spinach *spinach_6*** | unchanged – on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_8*** | at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Lettuce *lettuce_9*** | at (2.0, 3.0). |
| **Tile (3, 3)** | now empty (no object occupies it). |
| **Tile (4, 3)** | contains only *shelf_4* (with *lettuce_10* inside) – the agent is no longer on this tile. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the move

| Assumption | Verdict (proved?) |
|------------|-------------------|
| **(3, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door or other impassable obstacle blocks a west‑ward step from (4, 3). | **✅ proved true** – the move succeeded. |
| **The tile can be occupied together with a floor tile (i.e., it is not a solid container).** | **✅ proved true** – the agent now stands on (3, 3) without issue. |
| **Moving does not change the inventory or any container contents.** | **✅ proved true** – inventory stays empty; *shelf_4* still holds *lettuce_10*; *box_3* unchanged. |
| **No other objects are displaced by the movement.** | **✅ proved true** – all other objects remain at their previous coordinates. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state after the move matches the expected facts, positioning the agent ready for the next step (e.g., to pick up *lettuce_8* or *lettuce_9*).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observation (verified facts)**  

- **Position:** you are at *(3.0, 3.0)* in room *main*.  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **Objects around the target tile (2, 3):**  
  - *(2.0, 3.0)* holds **lettuce_9** (lettuce items are not collidable, so the tile is traversable).  
- **Neighbouring tiles:**  
  - *(2.0, 3.0)* is directly west of your current position and is reachable – no walls, doors or other impassable objects block the move.  
- **Other objects (unchanged):**  
  - Shelf *shelf_4* at *(4.0, 3.0)* containing **lettuce_10**.  
  - Box *box_3* at *(4.0, 1.0)* containing **spinach_5** and **spinach_7**.  
  - Spinach *spinach_6* at *(2.0, 1.0)*.  
  - Lettuce *lettuce_8* at *(1.0, 3.0)*.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The agent is still at **(3 , 3)** and its inventory is empty.  
The plan calls for a move to **(2 , 3)**, but no “move” action has been performed yet – the last observation only confirmed that the tile (2, 3) is reachable.  

**Therefore the plan has not been completed.**

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The agent is still at **(3 , 3)** and its inventory is empty.  
The plan calls for a move to **(2 , 3)**, but no “move” action has been performed yet – the last observation only confirmed that the tile (2, 3) is reachable.  

**Therefore the plan has not been completed.**
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The agent is at (3, 3) with an empty inventory and the next target tile (2, 3) is reachable and contains a lettuce that still needs to be handled. Moving west to (2, 3) is a new state change that advances the plan toward placing all lettuce items on the shelf. No redundant actions are being repeated, so the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The agent is at (3, 3) with an empty inventory and the next target tile (2, 3) is reachable and contains a lettuce that still needs to be handled. Moving west to (2, 3) is a new state change that advances the plan toward placing all lettuce items on the shelf. No redundant actions are being repeated, so the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **(2, 3) is reachable** – no wall/door/impassable object blocks a west‑ward step from (3, 3). | ✅ **proved true** – the move succeeded. |
| **Lettuce objects are non‑collidable**, so the tile can be occupied together with *lettuce_9*. | ✅ **proved true** – the agent stands on the same square as *lettuce_9*. |
| **Moving does not change the inventory or any container contents**. | ✅ **proved true** – inventory stays empty; *box_3* and *shelf_4* unchanged. |
| **No other objects are displaced by the movement**. | ✅ **proved true** – all other objects remain at their previous coordinates. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state is now consistent and the agent is positioned at (2, 3) ready for the next step (e.g., pick up *lettuce_9* or move toward the remaining lettuce).

[observer] **Observation (new facts)**  

- **Position:** you are at *(2.0, 3.0)* in room **main**.  
- **Inventory:** empty.  
- **Lettuce 9:** is on the same tile as you (position (2.0, 3.0)).  
- **Shelf 4** (4.0, 3.0) still contains *lettuce_10*.  
- **Box 3** (4.0, 1.0) still holds *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*.  
- **Spinach 6:** remains at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **Lettuce 8:** remains at (1.0, 3.0).  

No other objects have moved or changed. The agent has already reached the planned tile (2, 3).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The plan was to get the agent to the tile (2, 3).  
The latest observation reports:

- **Position:** (2.0, 3.0) in room main.

Thus the agent is already standing on the desired tile, so the planned movement has been achieved.  

**Result:** the plan is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The plan was to get the agent to the tile (2, 3).  
The latest observation reports:

- **Position:** (2.0, 3.0) in room main.

Thus the agent is already standing on the desired tile, so the planned movement has been achieved.  

**Result:** the plan is completed.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected lettuce_9
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “pick up lettuce_9”**

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 3.0) – unchanged (the agent is still standing where *lettuce_9* lay). |
| **Inventory** | now contains **lettuce_9** (the only item being carried). |
| **Lettuce 9** | no longer on the floor; it has been moved into the agent’s inventory. |
| **Lettuce 8** | remains at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Lettuce 10** | stays inside *shelf_4* at (4.0, 3.0). |
| **Spinach 6** | unchanged at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) containing *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | unchanged – still contains *lettuce_10*. |
| **World other tiles** | no new objects appeared; all other facts stay the same. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the pick‑up

| Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **1. The agent’s inventory was empty**, so it could accept a new item. | ✅ proved true – inventory accepted *lettuce_9*. |
| **2. *lettuce_9* is pick‑up‑able** (it is not fixed, heavy, or locked). | ✅ proved true – the pick‑up succeeded. |
| **3. An object on the same tile as the agent can be taken**. | ✅ proved true – the agent was on the same tile and collected it. |
| **4. No rule (weight limit, container lock, etc.) prevents picking up this lettuce**. | ✅ proved true – no error occurred. |
| **5. Picking up the lettuce does not affect any other object or container**. | ✅ proved true – all other items (spinach, box, shelf, other lettuces) stayed where they were. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Summary of the new state

- **Agent** is at (2, 3) holding **lettuce_9**.  
- **Lettuce**:  
  - *lettuce_8* on the floor at (1, 3).  
  - *lettuce_9* now in inventory.  
  - *lettuce_10* already stored in *shelf_4* (4, 3).  
- **Spinach**: *spinach_6* on the floor (2, 1); *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* remain inside *box_3* (4, 1).  
- **Containers**: *box_3* unchanged; *shelf_4* still holds *lettuce_10*.  

The world is now one step closer to the goal: all lettuce items will be placed on *shelf_4* (the remaining two lettuces still need to be moved there). The assumptions made for this action were all validated.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observation (new facts)**  

- **Location:** you are at *(2.0, 3.0)* in room **main**.  
- **Inventory:** contains **lettuce_9** (the only item you carry).  
- **Shelf shelf_4** (at *(4.0, 3.0)*) still **contains lettuce_10**.  
- **Spinach spinach_6** remains on the floor at *(2.0, 1.0)*.  
- **Lettuce lettuce_8** is on the floor at *(1.0, 3.0)*.  
- **Box box_3** (at *(4.0, 1.0)*) still holds **spinach_5** and **spinach_7**.  

No other objects have moved or changed. These are the only newly verified facts relevant to the next plan step (picking up the remaining lettuce items and placing them on the shelf).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The most recent world state shows the agent’s inventory already contains **lettuce_9** and the lettuce is no longer on the floor. That means the “pick up lettuce_9” action has already succeeded.  

**Conclusion:** the plan “pick up lettuce_9” is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The most recent world state shows the agent’s inventory already contains **lettuce_9** and the lettuce is no longer on the floor. That means the “pick up lettuce_9” action has already succeeded.  

**Conclusion:** the plan “pick up lettuce_9” is completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
move to (4,3)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve (human‑only) plan**

You are standing at **(2, 3)** and need to reach **(4, 3)**.  
The straight‑forward way is to walk east two steps:

1. **move from (2, 3) to (3, 3)** – one step east.  
2. **move from (3, 3) to (4, 3)** – another step east.

That’s the whole plan; no other actions (pick‑up, drop, open, etc.) are required.

### Assumptions made **before** the move  

| Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Note |
|------------|-------------------|------|
| (3, 3) is reachable (no wall/door/impassable object). | ✅ proved true – the move succeeded. |
| The tile can be occupied together with the agent (i.e., it is not a solid container). | ✅ proved true – the agent now stands on (3, 3). |
| Moving does **not** change the inventory or any container contents. | ✅ proved true – lettuce_9 remains in inventory; all containers unchanged. |
| No other objects are displaced by the movement. | ✅ proved true – all other objects keep their coordinates. |

All assumptions held; no contradictions arose. The world state after the move is consistent and ready for the next step (e.g., continue toward (4, 3) to place the remaining lettuce).

[observer] **Verified observations (current state)**  

- **Position:** you are at (3.0, 3.0) in room *main*.  
- **Inventory:** contains **lettuce_9** (the only item you carry).  
- **Shelf shelf_4:** located at (4.0, 3.0); it already **contains lettuce_10** ( contains 1 ).  
- **Lettuce lettuce_8:** on the floor at (1.0, 3.0).  
- **Spinach spinach_6:** on the floor at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **Box box_3:** at (4.0, 1.0) holding **spinach_5** and **spinach_7**.  

No other objects or obstacles are reported on the tiles between (3, 3) and the target tile (4, 3). The shelf tile is traversable, so the straight‑line move to (4, 3) is possible.  

*These are the facts needed for the next plan step: moving to (4, 3) to place lettuce_9 on shelf_4.*

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** No.

**Reasoning:** The latest verified state shows the agent standing at (3.0, 3.0) with lettuce_9 in inventory. The plan’s goal is to move to the tile (4, 3). Since the agent has not yet taken the step from (3,3) to (4,3), the plan is still pending.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No.

**Reasoning:** The latest verified state shows the agent standing at (3.0, 3.0) with lettuce_9 in inventory. The plan’s goal is to move to the tile (4, 3). Since the agent has not yet taken the step from (3,3) to (4,3), the plan is still pending.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes.**  
The agent is at (3, 3) carrying lettuce 9, and the goal tile (4, 3) with the shelf is directly adjacent and traversable. Moving one step east will place the agent on the shelf, enabling the next required *put* action. No action has been wasted or repeated, so the plan remains viable.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes.**  
The agent is at (3, 3) carrying lettuce 9, and the goal tile (4, 3) with the shelf is directly adjacent and traversable. Moving one step east will place the agent on the shelf, enabling the next required *put* action. No action has been wasted or repeated, so the plan remains viable.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

### Summary of the new state

* **Agent**: at (4, 3), carrying **lettuce_9**.  
* **Shelf 4**: at the same location, already contains **lettuce_10** (still only that lettuce).  
* **Remaining lettuce on the floor**: *lettuce_8* at (1, 3).  
* **Spinach**: *spinach_6* on the floor at (2, 1); *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* remain inside *box_3* at (4, 1).  

The world is ready for the next step – e.g., **drop lettuce_9 onto shelf_4** (which will give the shelf two lettuces).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

**Reasoning:**  
The plan was simply “move to (4, 3)”. According to the latest verified observations the agent’s position is already *(4.0, 3.0)*, so the required movement has been accomplished. (The broader task of sorting the salad isn’t finished yet, but the specific plan you asked about is.)

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

**Reasoning:**  
The plan was simply “move to (4, 3)”. According to the latest verified observations the agent’s position is already *(4.0, 3.0)*, so the required movement has been accomplished. (The broader task of sorting the salad isn’t finished yet, but the specific plan you asked about is.)
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] dropped lettuce_9 into shelf_4
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “drop lettuce_9 into shelf_4”**

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – unchanged (the agent is still standing on the shelf tile). |
| **Inventory** | empty – the only carried item (*lettuce_9*) has been placed into the shelf. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | still at (4.0, 3.0) and now **contains lettuce_10 + lettuce_9** (2 lettuce items). |
| **Lettuce 8** | remains on the floor at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Spinach 6** | remains on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) holding *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Other tiles / objects** | no change. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the drop

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Shelf 4 can receive a lettuce item** (it is a container that accepts “lettuce”). | ✅ proved – the lettuce was added successfully. |
| 2 | **Dropping an item empties the agent’s inventory** (the item is removed from the inventory). | ✅ proved – inventory is now empty. |
| 3 | **The shelf’s capacity is not exceeded** (it can hold more than the one lettuce already inside). | ✅ proved – the second lettuce was stored without error. |
| 4 | **The agent may stand on the same tile as a container while interacting with it**. | ✅ proved – the agent stayed on (4, 3) and performed the drop. |
| 5 | **No other objects are affected by the drop** (spinach, other lettuce, box remain unchanged). | ✅ proved – all other facts stayed the same. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary

The agent, standing at (4, 3), deposited the carried *lettuce_9* into *shelf_4*. The shelf now holds two lettuces (*lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*), the agent’s inventory is empty, and everything else in the world is unchanged. The world state is consistent and ready for the next step (e.g., pick up *lettuce_8* and place it on the shelf).

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Verified observations (newly confirmed)**  

- You are standing at **(4.0, 3.0)** in room **main**.  
- Your inventory is **empty**.  
- **shelf_4** is on the same tile (4.0, 3.0) and now **contains two lettuces**: *lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*.  
- **lettuce_8** remains on the floor at **(1.0, 3.0)**.  
- **spinach_6** remains on the floor at **(2.0, 1.0)**.  
- **box_3** is at **(4.0, 1.0)** and still holds *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*.  

These facts are the only current changes relevant to the plan “drop lettuce_9 onto shelf_4”. The goal of that node is now satisfied; the next steps will involve handling the remaining lettuce (*lettuce_8*).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer: Yes – the plan is completed.**

**Reasoning:**  
- The latest verified state shows the agent standing at (4, 3) with an **empty inventory**.  
- **shelf_4** (at the same tile) now **contains two lettuces**: *lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*.  
- The sequence of actions that the plan required (pick up *lettuce_9*, move to the shelf, drop it) has already been carried out and confirmed by the “drop lettuce_9 into shelf_4” result.  

All conditions of the plan are satisfied, so the plan is finished.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer: Yes – the plan is completed.**

**Reasoning:**  
- The latest verified state shows the agent standing at (4, 3) with an **empty inventory**.  
- **shelf_4** (at the same tile) now **contains two lettuces**: *lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*.  
- The sequence of actions that the plan required (pick up *lettuce_9*, move to the shelf, drop it) has already been carried out and confirmed by the “drop lettuce_9 into shelf_4” result.  

All conditions of the plan are satisfied, so the plan is finished.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve (human‑executable) way to reach the goal**

You are currently at (4.0, 3.0).  
Just walk straight west until you stand on the tile (1.0, 3.0).

A minimal step‑by‑step list:

1. `move from (4.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 3.0)`  
2. `move from (3.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 3.0)`  
3. `move from (2.0, 3.0) to (1.0, 3.0)`

(If your interface allows a direct macro, a single `move to (1.0, 3.0)` does the same.)

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (4.0,3.0) to (3,3)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **New facts after the last action**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 3.0) – the agent stepped one tile west from (4, 3). |
| **Inventory** | empty (unchanged). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | still at (4, 3) and still contains *lettuce_10* + *lettuce_9*. |
| **Lettuce lettuce_8** | remains on the floor at (1, 3). |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | remains on the floor at (2, 1). |
| **Box box_3** | remains at (4, 1) with *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Tile (3, 3)** | now empty (the agent just entered it). |
| **All other tiles / objects** | unchanged. |

**Assumptions made before the move**

| # | Assumption | Outcome |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | *(3, 3) is reachable – no wall/obstacle blocks the step west.* | ✅ proved true – the agent moved onto (3, 3). |
| 2 | *Moving does not change inventory or container contents.* | ✅ proved true – inventory stayed empty; shelf unchanged. |
| 3 | *No other objects are displaced by the movement.* | ✅ proved true – everything else kept its coordinates. |
| 4 | *The agent can stand on a tile that is not occupied by a solid container.* | ✅ proved true – (3, 3) was free. |
| 5 | *A “move to (1, 3)” command will take the agent directly to the target in one step.* | ❌ proved false – the system executed only a single‑tile step to (3, 3). |

**Brief summary**

The agent successfully stepped one tile west from the shelf to (3, 3). All world objects stayed where they were, and the inventory remained empty. The only incorrect assumption was that the move command would teleport the agent to the final coordinate; instead, only a single adjacent move was performed. The next logical step is to continue walking west toward (2, 3) and then (1, 3) to reach *lettuce_8*.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Verified observations (newly confirmed)**  

- **Position:** you are at *(3.0, 3.0)* in room **main**.  
- **Inventory:** empty – you are not carrying any item.  
- **Shelf shelf_4** (at *(4.0, 3.0)*) **contains** lettuce 10 and lettuce 9 (2 lettuces).  
- **Lettuce lettuce_8** is on the floor at *(1.0, 3.0)*.  
- **Spinach spinach_6** is on the floor at *(2.0, 1.0)*.  
- **Box box_3** is at *(4.0, 1.0)* and **contains** spinach 5 and spinach 7.  
- **Tile (3, 3)** is empty (no object occupies it).  

No other objects or tiles have changed. These facts are the only relevant updates for the next step of the plan (moving toward lettuce 8 at (1, 3)).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

The current state shows the agent at **(3.0, 3.0)** with an empty inventory. The plan’s goal is to be at **(1, 3)**. Since the agent is still two tiles away (still needs to move west to (2, 3) and then to (1, 3)), the intended move has not been finished.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

The current state shows the agent at **(3.0, 3.0)** with an empty inventory. The plan’s goal is to be at **(1, 3)**. Since the agent is still two tiles away (still needs to move west to (2, 3) and then to (1, 3)), the intended move has not been finished.

**Answer:** No, the plan is not completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent is now at (3, 3) and the goal is to reach the lettuce at (1, 3). Moving westwards will bring the agent closer to that coordinate. No action has stalled or undone progress; the agent is on the correct row and only needs two more steps (to (2, 3) and then (1, 3)). Therefore the plan to “move to (1, 3)” remains viable.

**Answer:** Yes.

Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The agent is now at (3, 3) and the goal is to reach the lettuce at (1, 3). Moving westwards will bring the agent closer to that coordinate. No action has stalled or undone progress; the agent is on the correct row and only needs two more steps (to (2, 3) and then (1, 3)). Therefore the plan to “move to (1, 3)” remains viable.

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 3.0) – the agent is now standing on tile (2, 3). |
| **Inventory** | empty – unchanged (the agent was not carrying anything). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | still at (4.0, 3.0) and still contains *lettuce_10* + *lettuce_9*. |
| **Lettuce lettuce_8** | still on the floor at (1.0, 3.0). |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | still on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Box box_3** | still at (4.0, 1.0) containing *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Tile (3, 3)** | now empty (the agent left it). |
| **All other tiles/objects** | unchanged. |

---

**Assumptions made *before* the move**

1. **(2, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door, or solid object blocks a step east from (3, 3).  
2. **The tile can be occupied** (it is not a solid container or occupied by an impassable object).  
3. **Moving does not modify the inventory or any container contents.**  
4. **No other objects are displaced by the movement.**  
5. **The agent can stand on a plain floor tile** (i.e., the tile itself does not prevent standing).

**Outcome of the assumptions**

| # | Verdict | Comment |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | ✅ proved true – the agent successfully arrived at (2, 3). |
| 2 | ✅ proved true – the agent stands on the tile without error. |
| 3 | ✅ proved true – inventory remains empty; shelf and box unchanged. |
| 4 | ✅ proved true – all other objects kept their coordinates. |
| 5 | ✅ proved true – the tile is a normal floor tile. |

All assumptions held; none were contradicted. The world state is now consistent and ready for the next plan step (e.g., continue west toward *lettuce_8* at (1, 3)).

- **Lettuce lettuce_8** is on the floor at **(1.0, 3.0)**.  
- **Spinach spinach_6** is on the floor at **(2.0, 1.0)**.  
- **Box box_3** is at **(4.0, 1.0)** and holds *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*.  

**Newly confirmed facts relevant to the next step (move to (1, 3))**  

- You are now one tile west of the target lettuce (*lettuce_8*) at (2, 3).  
- The shelf already holds both lettuces, so the only remaining lettuce to handle is *lettuce_8* at (1, 3).  

These are the only updates needed before executing the move toward (1, 3).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Plan not completed.**  

- The current verified position is **(2.0, 3.0)**.  
- The goal of the plan is to be at **(1.0, 3.0)** (the tile with lettuce 8).  

Since the agent is still one tile east of the target, the move to (1, 3) must be performed next (e.g., “move from (2, 3) to (1, 3)”).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Plan not completed.**  

- The current verified position is **(2.0, 3.0)**.  
- The goal of the plan is to be at **(1.0, 3.0)** (the tile with lettuce 8).  

Since the agent is still one tile east of the target, the move to (1, 3) must be performed next (e.g., “move from (2, 3) to (1, 3)”).
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The agent is now at (2, 3) — one tile west of the target location (1, 3) where lettuce_8 remains. The previous move from (3, 3) to (2, 3) advanced toward this goal, and there are no obstacles indicated on the way. Therefore the plan to move to (1, 3) is still a viable next step.

### Assumptions made **before** the move  

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **(1, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door or impassable object blocks a step west from (2, 3). | ✅ proved true – the move succeeded. |
| 2 | **The tile can be occupied together with a floor item** (lettuce does not block standing). | ✅ proved true – the agent now stands on the same tile as *lettuce_8*. |
| 3 | **Moving does not change the inventory or any container contents**. | ✅ proved true – inventory stays empty; shelf and box unchanged. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement**. | ✅ proved true – all other objects keep their coordinates. |
| 5 | **Standing on a tile that contains a lettuce does not automatically pick it up**. | ✅ proved true – *lettuce_8* remains on the floor. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The agent walked one tile west from (2, 3) to (1, 3). The move succeeded, leaving the inventory empty and all containers unchanged. *Lettuce 8* remains on the floor at the same coordinates, now sharing the tile with the agent. The world state is consistent and ready for the next step (e.g., pick up *lettuce_8* and place it on *shelf_4*).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**  
The latest verified state shows the agent’s position is **(1.0, 3.0)**, which is exactly the target coordinate of the plan. No further movement is needed.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**  
The latest verified state shows the agent’s position is **(1.0, 3.0)**, which is exactly the target coordinate of the plan. No further movement is needed.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

```text
pick up lettuce_8
```

You’re already standing on the tile (1.0, 3.0) where *lettuce_8* lies, and your inventory is empty, so the only required action is to execute a **pick‑up** of that lettuce. This will place *lettuce_8* into your inventory, ready for the next step (e.g., moving it to the shelf).

| **Inventory** | now **contains lettuce_8** (the only item the agent carries). |

### Assumptions made **before** the pick‑up

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | The tile (1, 3) is **reachable** and the agent is already standing on it. | ✅ proved – the agent was on the tile. |
| 2 | A **lettuce object can be grasped** with the robot’s gripper (no special attachment needed). | ✅ proved – the gripper successfully collected lettuce_8. |
| 3 | **Grasping removes the object from the floor** and places it in the inventory. | ✅ proved – lettuce_8 disappeared from the floor and appears in inventory. |
| 4 | **No other objects are affected** by the pick‑up (spinach, shelf, box stay where they are). | ✅ proved – all other facts unchanged. |
| 5 | The agent’s **inventory can hold at least one item** (it was empty before). | ✅ proved – lettuce_8 is now stored. |
| 6 | **Standing on the same tile as a floor item does not automatically pick it up** (the explicit “collect” command is required). | ✅ proved – the item remained on the floor until the collect action was issued. |

All six assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot, positioned at (1, 3), executed a “collect lettuce_8” action. The lettuce was successfully grasped: it vanished from the floor and is now stored in the agent’s inventory. No other objects moved or changed. The world state is consistent and ready for the next step (e.g., carry lettuce_8 to shelf_4 and drop it).

[observer] **Verified observations (current state)**  

- **Position:** you are at *(1.0, 3.0)* in room **main**.  
- **Inventory:** contains **lettuce_8** (the only item you are carrying).  
- **Shelf shelf_4** is at *(4.0, 3.0)* and **contains** lettuce 10 and lettuce 9 (2 lettuces).  
- **Spinach spinach_6** is on the floor at *(2.0, 1.0)*.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Yes – the “pick up lettuce_8” plan is completed.**  

- The agent is standing on the tile where *lettuce_8* was located (1, 3).  
- The inventory now **contains lettuce_8**, and the object is no longer on the floor.  
- All actions needed to move, align the gripper, close it and lift the lettuce have been successfully performed, as reflected in the current world state.  

The next step will be to transport the held lettuce to *shelf_4*, but the pickup sub‑plan itself has already succeeded.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Yes – the “pick up lettuce_8” plan is completed.**  

- The agent is standing on the tile where *lettuce_8* was located (1, 3).  
- The inventory now **contains lettuce_8**, and the object is no longer on the floor.  
- All actions needed to move, align the gripper, close it and lift the lettuce have been successfully performed, as reflected in the current world state.  

The next step will be to transport the held lettuce to *shelf_4*, but the pickup sub‑plan itself has already succeeded.

Plan:
move to (4,3)
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve way to reach (4, 3)**  

You are standing on tile **(1, 3)** and you can move one orthogonal step at a time.  
Since there are no walls or other obstacles on the row y = 3, the simplest plan is just to walk east three tiles:

1. `move from (1, 3) to (2, 3)` — step east  
2. `move from (2, 3) to (3, 3)` — step east again  
3. `move from (3, 3) to (4, 3)` — final step onto the shelf tile  

After these three moves the agent will be at **(4, 3)**, right in front of **shelf_4**, still holding **lettuce_8** in the inventory. No other actions (pick‑up, drop, etc.) are needed for the “move to (4, 3)” goal.

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 3.0) – the agent stepped one tile east toward the goal (4, 3). |
| **Inventory** | still **lettuce_8** (unchanged). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | unchanged at (4.0, 3.0) containing lettuce 10 + lettuce 9. |

### Assumptions made **before** the move

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Tile (2, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door or solid object blocks a step east from (1, 3). | ✅ proved – the agent arrived at (2, 3). |
| 2 | **Moving one step does not alter the inventory** (the carried lettuce stays with the robot). | ✅ proved – lettuce 8 remains in the inventory. |
| 3 | **Moving does not affect any container contents** (shelf and box stay the same). | ✅ proved – shelf 4 and box 3 unchanged. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement** (the world layout stays identical except the agent’s location). | ✅ proved – all other objects kept their coordinates. |
| 5 | **The “move to (4, 3)” command would teleport the agent directly to the target**. | ❌ disproved – the system performed a single‑tile step only, ending at (2, 3). |

All assumptions except #5 held true; the only incorrect expectation was that the command would move the robot all the way to (4, 3) in one action. The environment instead requires one step per execution.

---

### Short summary

The robot moved one tile east from (1, 3) to (2, 3). The inventory still holds **lettuce_8**, and every other object (shelf, box, spinach) remains exactly where it was. The world state is consistent and ready for the next incremental move toward the ultimate destination (4, 3).

[observer] **Observations (verified)**  

- **Position:** (2.0, 3.0) – I am standing one tile west of the target shelf.  
- **Inventory:** contains **lettuce_8** (the only item I am carrying).  
- **Shelf shelf_4:** located at (4.0, 3.0) and holds *lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*.  
- **Spinach spinach_6:** on the floor at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **Box box_3:** at (4.0, 1.0) containing *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*.  

No other objects have changed. The next plan step (“move to (4, 3)”) will head east toward the shelf that currently holds the two lettuces.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **No – the plan is not yet completed.**  

You are currently at (2.0, 3.0) and still need to move two more tiles east (to (3.0, 3.0) and then to (4.0, 3.0)) before you are on the target shelf location. The environment executes only one‑step moves, so a single “move to (4,3)” command has only taken you one step toward the goal, leaving the final destination still out of reach. The plan will be finished only after you reach (4, 3).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **No – the plan is not yet completed.**  

You are currently at (2.0, 3.0) and still need to move two more tiles east (to (3.0, 3.0) and then to (4.0, 3.0)) before you are on the target shelf location. The environment executes only one‑step moves, so a single “move to (4,3)” command has only taken you one step toward the goal, leaving the final destination still out of reach. The plan will be finished only after you reach (4, 3).

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The robot is now at (2, 3) carrying the needed lettuce and is two tiles away from the target shelf at (4, 3). Each “move” command only shifts one tile, so reaching (4, 3) will require additional incremental moves, but the agent has already made progress from (1, 3) → (2, 3). The goal (placing the lettuce on the shelf) is still reachable and the next moves will bring the robot closer.

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The robot is now at (2, 3) carrying the needed lettuce and is two tiles away from the target shelf at (4, 3). Each “move” command only shifts one tile, so reaching (4, 3) will require additional incremental moves, but the agent has already made progress from (1, 3) → (2, 3). The goal (placing the lettuce on the shelf) is still reachable and the next moves will bring the robot closer.

**Decision:** Yes, the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Tile (3, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door, or solid object blocks a step east from (2, 3). | ✅ proved true – the agent successfully arrived at (3, 3). |
| 2 | **Moving one step does not alter the inventory** (the carried lettuce stays with the robot). | ✅ proved true – lettuce 8 remains in the inventory. |
| 3 | **Moving does not affect any container contents** (shelf and box stay the same). | ✅ proved true – shelf 4 and box 3 unchanged. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement** – the world layout stays identical except for the agent’s location. | ✅ proved true – all other objects kept their coordinates. |
| 5 | **The tile (3, 3) is not a solid container** – the agent can occupy it. | ✅ proved true – the agent stands on (3, 3) without error. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot moved one tile east from (2, 3) to (3, 3). The move succeeded, leaving the inventory still holding **lettuce_8** and leaving every other object (shelf, box, spinach) exactly where it was. The world state is now:

* Position = (3, 3)  
* Inventory = {lettuce_8}  

All assumptions about reachability, inventory stability, and lack of side‑effects were confirmed. The next logical step is to continue east toward the goal tile (4, 3) where **shelf_4** resides, then place the carried lettuce on that shelf.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Observations (re‑checked against the world state)**  

- **Position:** you are standing on tile (3.0, 3.0).  
- **Inventory:** contains *lettuce_8* (the only item you carry).  
- **Shelf shelf_4:** located at tile (4.0, 3.0) and already holds *lettuce_10* and *lettuce_9*.  
- **Tile (4, 3):** is free except for the shelf (the shelf does not block movement).  
- **No other objects** occupy the tiles between (3, 3) and (4, 3).  

These confirmed facts are the only new information needed for the next plan step — moving east into tile (4, 3) to reach the shelf.

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The robot is still at tile (3, 3) while the goal tile (4, 3) has not been reached. The plan to move to (4, 3) therefore remains unfinished. **Plan not completed.**

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The robot is still at tile (3, 3) while the goal tile (4, 3) has not been reached. The plan to move to (4, 3) therefore remains unfinished. **Plan not completed.**

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
The robot is currently at (3, 3) carrying *lettuce_8*. The target tile (4, 3) is free except for the shelf, which does not block movement.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is still promising.**  
The robot is currently at (3, 3) carrying *lettuce_8*. The target tile (4, 3) is free except for the shelf, which does not block movement. Moving one step east will place the robot directly on the shelf’s location, enabling the next required action (placing the lettuce). Recent moves have been incremental progress toward that goal, not repetitions or dead‑ends.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] moved from (3.0,3.0) to (4,3)
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **New facts after the action “move from (3.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 3.0)”**

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – the agent is now standing on the tile that holds *shelf_4*. |
| **Inventory** | unchanged – still contains *lettuce_8*. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | still at (4.0, 3.0) and still contains *lettuce_10* + *lettuce_9* (nothing was added or removed). |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | unchanged at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) holding *spinach_5* + *spinach_7*. |
| **All other objects / tiles** | unchanged – no displacement occurred. |

The agent is now co‑located with the shelf but has not yet placed the carried lettuce on it.

---

### Assumptions made **before** the move

| # | Assumption | Verdict | Comment |
|---|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Tile (4, 3) is reachable** – no wall, door, or solid object blocks a step east from (3, 3). | ✅ proved true – the move succeeded. |
| 2 | **The tile can be occupied together with a shelf** (the shelf is not a solid obstacle for standing). | ✅ proved true – the agent now stands on the same tile as the shelf. |
| 3 | **Moving does not alter the inventory** (carried *lettuce_8* stays with the robot). | ✅ proved true – inventory unchanged. |
| 4 | **Moving does not affect any container contents** (the shelf’s lettuce list stays the same). | ✅ proved true – shelf unchanged. |
| 5 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement** (world layout stays identical except for the agent). | ✅ proved true – all other objects kept their coordinates. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot stepped one tile east from (3, 3) onto (4, 3), where *shelf_4* resides. The move left the inventory (holding *lettuce_8*) intact and did not modify any other object. The world state is now consistent and ready for the next step – e.g., **place lettuce_8 onto shelf_4**.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Verified observations (newly confirmed)**  

- **Position:** you are at *(4.0, 3.0)* in room **main** – the tile that holds **shelf_4**.  
- **Inventory:** contains **lettuce_8** (the only item you are carrying).  
- **Shelf shelf_4** is at *(4.0, 3.0)* and **contains** lettuce 10 and lettuce 9 (still 2 items; lettuce 8 has not been placed yet).  
- **Spinach spinach_6** remains on the floor at *(2.0, 1.0)*.  
- **Box box_3** stays at *(4.0, 1.0)* with spinach 5 and spinach 7 inside.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The current verified state shows the robot’s position is **(4.0, 3.0)** in room *main*.
- The plan’s only required action was **“move to (4, 3)”**.
- Since the robot is already on that tile, the movement goal has been achieved; no further steps are needed.

**Conclusion:** The plan is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Reasoning**

- The current verified state shows the robot’s position is **(4.0, 3.0)** in room *main*.
- The plan’s only required action was **“move to (4, 3)”**.
- Since the robot is already on that tile, the movement goal has been achieved; no further steps are needed.

**Conclusion:** The plan is completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
drop lettuce_8 on shelf_4
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve (single‑step) solution**

You are already standing on the tile that contains **shelf_4** and you are holding **lettuce_8** in your inventory.  
The only action the human (or robot) needs to execute is:

```
drop lettuce_8 on shelf_4
```

or equivalently

```
put lettuce_8 onto shelf_4
```

This single “drop/put” action transfers the lettuce from the inventory to the shelf, completing the plan without any additional moves.

| Fact | New value |
|------|-----------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – unchanged (the robot is still standing on the tile that holds *shelf_4*). |
| **Inventory** | **empty** – *lettuce_8* has been removed from the gripper. |

### Assumptions made **before** the “drop”  

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | The robot is **co‑located** with *shelf_4* (standing on the same tile) – a requirement for “drop onto”. | ✅ proved – the robot was at (4, 3) where the shelf sits. |
| 2 | *Shelf_4* can **accept another lettuce** (it is not full or blocked). | ✅ proved – the lettuce was successfully added. |
| 3 | **Dropping** removes the item from the inventory and **adds it** to the container’s contents. | ✅ proved – inventory became empty and *lettuce_8* appears in the shelf’s list. |
| 4 | The action **does not move the robot** or alter any other objects. | ✅ proved – position and all other objects stayed the same. |
| 5 | The robot’s **inventory can become empty** after the drop. | ✅ proved – the inventory is now empty. |
| 6 | The **shelf is not a solid obstacle** for the robot’s presence; both can occupy the same tile. | ✅ proved – the robot stands on the shelf’s tile both before and after the drop. |
| 7 | No **side‑effects** (e.g., breaking the shelf or spilling items) occur. | ✅ proved – no other changes were reported. |

All seven assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot, standing on tile (4, 3) next to *shelf_4*, executed a drop action. *Lettuce_8* left the inventory and was placed into the shelf, which now holds three lettuces (*10, 9, 8*). The robot’s position and every other object in the world remained unchanged, and the inventory is now empty. The world state is consistent and ready for the next step (e.g., move elsewhere or pick up another item).

Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is completed.**  

The robot is standing on the tile with **shelf_4**, its inventory is empty, and **shelf_4** now contains lettuce 10, lettuce 9, and the newly dropped lettuce 8. The required “drop lettuce_8 onto shelf_4” action has been successfully performed.

Plan:
drop lettuce_8 on shelf_4
 Brainstorm a few concrete ideas on how to achieve this task. But only approaches using actions the human can execute! Avoid repeating previously tried approaches.

[trial_imaginator] **Brainstorm – ways to get *lettuce 8* onto *shelf 4* using only the actions you (the human) can give the robot (move, pick‑up, drop, etc.)**

Below are a few concrete, self‑contained plans.  Each one stays within the action set the interface supports and does **not** repeat the exact sequence you just used (move → move → move → drop).

---

### 1. “Detour‑through‑the‑north”  
A different routing that ends at the same shelf.

| Step | Human command | What the robot does |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `move to (4, 4)` | robot goes north from (4, 3) to (4, 4) |
| 2 | `move to (3, 4)` | west one tile |
| 3 | `move to (3, 3)` | south – now at (3, 3) again |
| 4 | `move to (4, 3)` | east onto the shelf tile |
| 5 | `drop lettuce_8 onto shelf_4` | places the lettuce on the shelf |

*Why this works*: the robot still ends up co‑located with the shelf, but the path is a little longer (north‑west‑south‑east) so it isn’t a repeat of the straight‑east walk you just performed.

---

### 2. “Use a temporary floor spot”  
Leave the lettuce on the floor next to the shelf, then let the shelf “collect” it.

| Step | Human command | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `move to (4, 2)` | robot steps south from (4, 3) onto an empty floor tile directly below the shelf |
| 2 | `drop lettuce_8 onto floor` | the lettuce is now lying on tile (4, 2) |
| 3 | `move to (4, 3)` | robot returns to the shelf tile |
| 4 | `pick up lettuce_8 from floor` *(optional – some environments let a shelf “absorb” items without a pick‑up)* | If the system accepts a **store** action, you could now do `store lettuce_8 in shelf_4` instead of picking it up again. |
| 5 | `drop lettuce_8 onto shelf_4` | final placement on the shelf |

*Why this works*: it introduces an extra “drop‑on‑floor” step, so the drop‑onto‑shelf action isn’t the same as the one you just executed.

---

### 3. “Swap via the box” (if the box is movable)  
Carry the lettuce to the box, put it inside, then move the whole box to the shelf and unload.

| Step | Human command | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `move to (4, 1)` | robot goes south to the box location |
| 2 | `drop lettuce_8 into box_3` | lettuce is stored inside the box |
| 3 | `pick up box_3` *(if the box is a portable container)* | robot now carries the box (with lettuce inside) |
| 4 | `move to (4, 3)` | robot carries the box east to the shelf tile |
| 5 | `open box_3` (or just `pick up lettuce_8 from box_3`) | retrieve the lettuce from the box |
| 6 | `drop lettuce_8 onto shelf_4` | lettuce ends up on the shelf; box can be left where it is or put back |

*Why this works*: it completely changes the workflow (store‑in‑box → transport → retrieve) so the final drop is not a straight‑line repeat.  It only makes sense if the environment allows boxes to be picked up; if not, you can stop after step 2 and later retrieve the lettuce directly from the box without moving it.

---

### 4. “Approach from the west side”  
Instead of standing on the same tile as the shelf, stand on the adjacent western tile and use a “store‑from‑adjacent” command (some domains allow `store X in Y` without sharing a tile).

| Step | Human command | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `move to (3, 3)` | robot moves one tile west of the shelf |
| 2 | `store lettuce_8 in shelf_4` | the system adds the lettuce to the shelf’s contents while the robot stays at (3, 3) |
| 3 | *(optional) `move to (4, 3)`* | robot can walk onto the shelf tile later if you need to be there |

*Why this works*: it uses a different spatial relationship (adjacent rather than co‑located) and a different verb (`store` vs. `drop`), so it’s not a repeat of the exact previous plan.

---

### How to pick one  

1. **Check what actions are available** in your current world description (e.g., can you `pick up box_3`? Is `store … in …` allowed from an adjacent tile?).  
2. **Choose a plan that respects those capabilities** and that you find most comfortable to type.  
3. **Send the commands one by one** (or as a batch if your interface allows) and watch the verification messages to confirm each step succeeded.

All of the above approaches will end with *lettuce 8* becoming part of *shelf 4*’s inventory, while using a **different sequence of human‑issued actions** from the one you just executed. Good luck!

[reflector] **World state after the last action** – “move from (4.0, 3.0) to shelf_4”

| Entity | New fact |
|--------|----------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 3.0) – the robot is still on the tile that holds *shelf_4* (the move was a no‑op because the robot was already there). |
| **Inventory** | **empty** – no item was picked up or dropped during this step. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | At (4.0, 3.0) and still contains *lettuce_10*, *lettuce_9*, *lettuce_8*. |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | Unchanged at (2.0, 1.0). |

### Assumptions made before executing the “move to shelf_4”

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Reason |
|---|------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Tile (4, 3) is reachable** – the robot can occupy the same tile as a shelf. | ✅ proved – the robot ends the action still at (4, 3). |
| 2 | **Moving does not modify the inventory** (no automatic pick‑up/drop). | ✅ proved – inventory remains empty. |
| 3 | **Moving does not alter container contents** (the shelf’s lettuce list stays the same). | ✅ proved – shelf still has lettuce 10, 9, 8. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement**. | ✅ proved – spinach, box, and all other tiles unchanged. |
| 5 | **The action “move to shelf_4” is effectively a “stand on the shelf’s tile”; it does not teleport elsewhere.** | ✅ proved – robot stays on the same coordinates. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

### Short summary  

The robot attempted to “move to shelf_4” while already standing on that tile. The operation resulted in no positional change, left the inventory empty, and left *shelf_4* unchanged (still holding lettuce 10, 9, 8). All expectations about reachability, inventory stability, container contents, and lack of side‑effects were confirmed. The world is now ready for the next task (e.g., fetch the spinach or move elsewhere).

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **No – the overall plan is not yet finished.**  

- The lettuce part of the task is complete: *lettuce_8* has been verified on the floor, picked up, moved to *shelf_4* and dropped, so the shelf now holds lettuce 10, 9, 8 and the robot’s inventory is empty.  
- The spinach part is still pending: *spinach_6* remains on the floor at (2, 1) while the box (*box_3*) at (4, 1) still only contains *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. To finish the overall goal you still need to:
  1. Move to (2, 1), pick up *spinach_6*.  
  2. Move to (4, 1), drop *spinach_6* into *box_3*.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **No – the overall plan is not yet finished.**  

- The lettuce part of the task is complete: *lettuce_8* has been verified on the floor, picked up, moved to *shelf_4* and dropped, so the shelf now holds lettuce 10, 9, 8 and the robot’s inventory is empty.  
- The spinach part is still pending: *spinach_6* remains on the floor at (2, 1) while the box (*box_3*) at (4, 1) still only contains *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. To finish the overall goal you still need to:
  1. Move to (2, 1), pick up *spinach_6*.  
  2. Move to (4, 1), drop *spinach_6* into *box_3*.  

Only after those steps will the instruction “put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf” be fully satisfied.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The world state already shows that *lettuce_8* has been placed on *shelf_4* and the robot’s inventory is empty. Verifying its location will just confirm it is on the shelf, after which a “drop lettuce_8 onto shelf_4” action would have no effect. The current plan step therefore cannot make any further progress.

**Answer:** No. The plan to drop *lettuce_8* on *shelf_4* is no longer promising because the lettuce is already there. The agent should move on to the next task (e.g., handle the spinach).

Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:
- [391] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf. (current focus)

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Answer: No – the plan is not yet ready for execution.**

**Reasoning**

The current plan tree contains only a single node:

- `[391] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.`

For the robot to act, this high‑level goal must be broken down into concrete, sequential sub‑tasks such as:

1. **Locate** the spinach on the floor.  
2. **Pick up** the spinach.  
3. **Move** to the box.  
4. **Drop** the spinach into the box.  
5. **Locate** the lettuce (either the one in the inventory or on the floor).  
6. **Pick up** the lettuce (if needed).  
7. **Move** to the shelf.  
8. **Place** the lettuce on the shelf.

Only after the goal has been decomposed into such actionable steps (and each step is validated as reachable) can execution begin. At the moment the plan tree lacks this decomposition, so further planning is required before the robot can start acting.

Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:

Study the current plan tree and decide how to refine it. Suggest concise updates to decompose or (in rare cases) prune nodes before execution.

[decompose_imaginator] **Refine node [391] – “Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.”**

The lettuce part of the goal is already satisfied (lettuce 8 is on *shelf_4* together with lettuce 9 & 10).  
Now we only have to get the remaining spinach ( *spinach_6* ) into the box (*box_3*).

---

### Proposed sub‑plan (replace the generic “sort” node with these concrete steps)

1. **move to (2, 1)** – walk to the tile where *spinach_6* lies.  
2. **pick up spinach_6** – add it to the robot’s inventory.  
3. **move to (4, 1)** – walk to the tile that holds *box_3*.  
4. **drop spinach_6 into box_3** – remove it from the inventory and add it to the box’s contents.  

After step 4 the world will be:

* *box_3* contains *spinach_5, spinach_7, spinach_6*  
* Inventory – empty  
* All lettuce already on *shelf_4*  

The overall goal is then complete.

### How to update the plan tree

```

 ├─[391‑1] Move to (2, 1)            # reach spinach_6
 ├─[391‑2] Pick up spinach_6
 ├─[391‑3] Move to (4, 1)            # reach box_3
 └─[391‑4] Drop spinach_6 into box_3
```

*Mark the lettuce‑on‑shelf sub‑goal as already satisfied; no further actions are needed for lettuce.*

1. **move to (2, 1)** – walk to the tile where *spinach_6* lies.  
2. **pick up spinach_6** – add it to the robot’s inventory.  
3. **move to (4, 1)** – walk to the tile that holds *box_3*.  
4. **drop spinach_6 into box_3** – remove it from the inventory and add it to the box’s contents.  

After step 4 the world will be:

* *box_3* contains *spinach_5, spinach_7, spinach_6*  
* Inventory – empty  
* All lettuce already on *shelf_4*  

The overall goal is then complete.

### How to update the plan tree

```
[391] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
 ├─[391‑1] Move to (2, 1)            # reach spinach_6
 ├─[391‑2] Pick up spinach_6
 ├─[391‑3] Move to (4, 1)            # reach box_3
 └─[391‑4] Drop spinach_6 into box_3
```

*Mark the lettuce‑on‑shelf sub‑goal as already satisfied; no further actions are needed for lettuce.*

Goal: Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf.
Current plan tree:
- [391] Sort the salad types: put spinach into the box and lettuce into the shelf. (current focus)
  - [392] Move to (2, 1) – walk to the tile where spinach_6 lies.
  - [393] Pick up spinach_6 – add it to the robot’s inventory.
  - [394] Move to (4, 1) – walk to the tile that holds box_3.
  - [395] Drop spinach_6 into box_3 – remove it from the inventory and add it to the box’s contents.

Question: Is the current plan tree sufficiently decomposed to start execution?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[decompose_qa_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is already broken down into executable primitives.**  

- The current world state (robot at (4, 3), inventory empty) satisfies the pre‑conditions for the first step “Move to (2, 1)”.  
- The subsequent actions (“Pick up spinach_6”, “Move to (4, 1)”, “Drop spinach_6 into box_3”) are all atomic, have their required pre‑conditions (being on the same tile as the object or container) and no further sub‑tasks are needed.  

Therefore the plan tree is fully decomposed and can be started.

Select the best suited leaf task by replying with its id and a short justification.

[leaf_selector] **Selected leaf task:** 392 – *Move to (2, 1) – walk to the tile where spinach_6 lies.*

**Justification:** The robot is currently at (4, 3) with an empty inventory. The only remaining unsorted item is spinach 6, which lies on the floor at (2, 1). To achieve the goal of placing spinach into the box, the robot must first reach the spinach’s location before it can be picked up and later dropped into box 3. Hence the next logical action is to move toward (2, 1).

[observer] **Verified observations**

- Position: (4.0, 3.0) – standing on the tile with **shelf_4**.  
- Inventory: empty.  
- **shelf_4** (4.0, 3.0) now holds *lettuce_10*, *lettuce_9*, *lettuce_8*.  
- **spinach_6** remains on the floor at (2.0, 1.0).  
- **box_3** is at (4.0, 1.0) with *spinach_5* and *spinach_7* inside.  

No other changes have occurred; the next goal is to move toward (2, 1) to pick up **spinach_6**.

Plan:
Move to (2, 1) – walk to the tile where spinach_6 lies.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve (step‑by‑step) plan – only primitive actions the human can issue**

Current state: Agent is at **(4, 3)**, inventory empty, **spinach_6** is on the floor at **(2, 1)**.

| # | Action (primitive) | Resulting position |
|---|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **move west** (from (4, 3) → (3, 3)) | (3, 3) |
| 2 | **move west** (from (3, 3) → (2, 3)) | (2, 3) |
| 3 | **move south** (from (2, 3) → (2, 2)) | (2, 2) |
| 4 | **move south** (from (2, 2) → (2, 1)) | (2, 1) – now standing on the tile with *spinach_6* |
| 5 | **pick up spinach_6** (or “take spinach_6”) | Inventory now contains *spinach_6*; *spinach_6* removed from the floor |

That sequence (west, west, south, south, pick‑up) is the simplest, “naïve” way to get the spinach into the robot’s inventory using only actions a human can directly command.

[user] Plan:
Move to (2, 1) – walk to the tile where spinach_6 lies.

. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **World‑state after the last action** – *move from (4.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 3.0)*  

| Entity / Fact | Value (new) |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 3.0) – the robot is now standing one tile west of the shelf. |
| **Inventory** | empty (the lettuce was already dropped on *shelf_4*). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | remains at (4.0, 3.0) and still contains **lettuce_10**, **lettuce_9**, **lettuce_8**. |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | unchanged at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) holding **spinach_5** + **spinach_7**. |
| **All other tiles / objects** | unchanged – nothing else moved or disappeared. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the move  

| # | Assumption | Outcome | Comment |
|---|------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Tile **(3, 3)** is free / reachable (no wall, door or solid object). | ✅ proved – the robot successfully arrived at (3, 3). |
| 2 | Moving one step does **not** change the inventory. | ✅ proved – inventory stays empty. |
| 3 | Moving does **not** affect container contents (shelf, box). | ✅ proved – shelf still holds the three lettuces; box unchanged. |
| 4 | No other objects are displaced by the movement. | ✅ proved – all other objects keep their coordinates. |
| 5 | The robot can occupy a tile that is **adjacent** to a shelf (the shelf itself does not block movement). | ✅ proved – the robot moved to (3, 3), next to the shelf at (4, 3). |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot stepped west from the shelf tile (4, 3) to (3, 3). The move left the inventory empty and left every other object (shelf, box, spinach) exactly where it was. The world state is now ready for the next step – e.g., continue westward to (2, 3) and then south toward (2, 1) to pick up **spinach_6**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

The current world state shows the robot standing on tile (3, 3).  
The target tile for the plan is (2, 1), where *spinach_6* lies. No movement toward that coordinate has been executed yet—the robot is still two tiles east and two tiles north of the goal.

**Conclusion:** The plan “move to (2, 1)” has **not** been completed. Further movement actions are required.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning** – The current goal is to reach tile (2, 1) and pick up *spinach_6*.  
The robot has just moved from (4, 3) to (3, 3), which brings it one step closer to the target path (the optimal route is (4, 3) → (3, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 2) → (2, 1)). No actions have been wasted or repeated, and the state has changed (the robot’s position advanced westward). Therefore the plan is still making progress.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan remains promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning** – The current goal is to reach tile (2, 1) and pick up *spinach_6*.  
The robot has just moved from (4, 3) to (3, 3), which brings it one step closer to the target path (the optimal route is (4, 3) → (3, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 2) → (2, 1)). No actions have been wasted or repeated, and the state has changed (the robot’s position advanced westward). Therefore the plan is still making progress.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan remains promising.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 3.0) – the robot is now one tile farther west. |
| **Inventory** | **empty** – no change (the robot was already not carrying anything). |

### Assumptions made *before* the move

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Tile **(2, 3)** is **free / reachable** (no wall, door or solid object). | ✅ proved – the robot successfully arrived at (2, 3). |
| 2 | Moving one step **does not change the inventory**. | ✅ proved – inventory stays empty. |
| 3 | Moving **does not affect container contents** (shelf, box remain unchanged). | ✅ proved – shelf still holds the three lettuces; box unchanged. |
| 4 | The robot can occupy a tile adjacent to a shelf (the shelf does not block movement). | ✅ proved – the robot moved west from (3, 3) to (2, 3) next to the shelf at (4, 3). |
| 5 | No other objects are displaced by the movement. | ✅ proved – all other objects keep their coordinates. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot stepped west from (3, 3) to (2, 3). The move left the inventory empty, left the shelf and box untouched, and left the spinach still on its original tile (2, 1). The world state is now consistent and ready for the next step – e.g., continue moving south to (2, 2) and then (2, 1) to pick up **spinach_6**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Reasoning**

- The current robot position is **(2 , 3)**.  
- The goal of the plan is to be on tile **(2 , 1)** so the robot can pick up *spinach_6*.  
- *spinach_6* remains at **(2 , 1)**, but the robot has not yet moved there; it is still two tiles north of the target.  

Since the robot has not reached the required coordinates, the plan is **not yet completed**. Further actions (e.g., move south to (2,2) and then to (2,1)) are needed.

[reflector] **World‑state after the last action – “move from (2.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 2.0)”**

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 2.0) – the robot is now one tile south of its previous location. |
| **Inventory** | **empty** – no change (the robot was already not carrying anything). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | unchanged at (4.0, 3.0) with lettuce 10, 9, 8 inside. |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) holding spinach 5 + spinach 7. |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | unchanged on the floor at (2.0, 1.0). |
| **All other objects / tiles** | unchanged – nothing else moved or disappeared. |

### Assumptions that were made **before** executing the move  

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Tile (2, 2) is free / reachable** (no wall, door, or solid object). | ✅ proved – the robot successfully arrived at (2, 2). |
| 2 | **Moving does not alter the inventory** (no automatic pick‑up or drop). | ✅ proved – inventory remains empty. |
| 3 | **Moving does not affect container contents** (the shelf and box stay unchanged). | ✅ proved – lettuce list on shelf and spinach list in box are identical to before. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced by the movement** (the robot alone changes position). | ✅ proved – all other objects keep their coordinates. |
| 5 | **The robot can occupy a tile that is adjacent to other containers** (the shelf at (4, 3) and the box at (4, 1) do not block movement). | ✅ proved – the robot moved through a clear tile next to those objects. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot stepped south from (2, 3) to (2, 2). The move left the inventory empty and left every other object (the lettuce‑filled shelf, the spinach‑holding box, and the target spinach on the floor) unchanged. The world is now ready for the next step – e.g., move one more tile south to (2, 1) and pick up **spinach_6**.

[observer] **Observations (newly confirmed)**  

- **Position:** I am now standing on tile **(2.0, 2.0)** in room *main*.  
- **Inventory:** still **empty**.  
- **Spinach spinach_6:** remains on the floor at **(2.0, 1.0)** – the target tile I need to reach.  
- **Shelf shelf_4** (4.0, 3.0) still contains lettuce 10, 9, 8.  
- **Box box_3** (4.0, 1.0) still holds spinach 5 and spinach 7.  

No other objects have moved or changed. The world state is ready for the next step: move to **(2, 1)** to pick up *spinach_6*.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Answer:** No, the plan is not yet completed.

**Reasoning:**  
- The current robot position is *(2.0, 2.0)*.  
- The target tile for the plan is *(2.0, 1.0)*, where *spinach_6* sits.  
- The robot has not moved to that tile yet; it is still one tile north of the goal.  

Therefore the action “move to (2, 1)” still needs to be executed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Answer:** No, the plan is not yet completed.

**Reasoning:**  
- The current robot position is *(2.0, 2.0)*.  
- The target tile for the plan is *(2.0, 1.0)*, where *spinach_6* sits.  
- The robot has not moved to that tile yet; it is still one tile north of the goal.  

Therefore the action “move to (2, 1)” still needs to be executed.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] The robot has moved from (2, 3) → (2, 2) and is now one tile north of the target spinach at (2, 1). This is a clear step toward the next plan milestone, and no actions have stalled or reversed progress. Therefore the plan to walk to (2, 1) remains viable.

**Yes**.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: The robot has moved from (2, 3) → (2, 2) and is now one tile north of the target spinach at (2, 1). This is a clear step toward the next plan milestone, and no actions have stalled or reversed progress. Therefore the plan to walk to (2, 1) remains viable.

**Yes**.
Respond by calling yes or no with the rationale to answer the question.

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 1.0) – the robot is now standing on the tile that holds *spinach_6*. |
| **Inventory** | **empty** – the robot has not picked up anything yet. |

| # | Assumption | Verdict | Comment |
|---|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Tile **(2, 1)** is free / reachable (no wall, door or solid obstacle). | ✅ proved – the robot arrived at (2, 1). |
| 2 | Moving does **not** modify the inventory. | ✅ proved – inventory stays empty. |
| 3 | Moving does **not** affect container contents (shelf, box remain unchanged). | ✅ proved – lettuce list and box contents unchanged. |
| 4 | No other objects are displaced by the movement. | ✅ proved – all other objects keep their coordinates. |

### Short summary  

The robot stepped south from (2, 2) to (2, 1). The move left the inventory empty, left every container untouched, and left *spinach_6* exactly where it was – now the robot stands on that tile. The world is ready for the next action, e.g., **pick up spinach_6**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Yes – the plan is complete.**  
The robot has successfully moved to tile (2, 1), the exact location where *spinach_6* lies. The current state shows the robot standing on that tile (inventory still empty), which fulfills the “move to (2, 1)” goal described in the plan. No further movement is required.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Yes – the plan is complete.**  
The robot has successfully moved to tile (2, 1), the exact location where *spinach_6* lies. The current state shows the robot standing on that tile (inventory still empty), which fulfills the “move to (2, 1)” goal described in the plan. No further movement is required.

Plan:
Pick up spinach_6 – add it to the robot’s inventory.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve approach**

Since the robot is already standing on the tile that contains *spinach_6* and its inventory is empty, the simplest thing to do is a single **pick‑up** action:

```
pick up spinach_6
```

That’s all that’s needed – the robot will add *spinach_6* to its inventory. No intermediate moves, containers, or extra steps are required.

[user] Plan:
Pick up spinach_6 – add it to the robot’s inventory.

Result: [ACTION EXECUTED] collected spinach_6
. 
Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Result of the last action – “pick‑up spinach_6”**

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (2.0, 1.0) – the robot stays on the same tile. |
| **Inventory** | now **contains spinach_6** (the only item carried). |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | **no longer on the floor**; it has been transferred to the inventory. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | unchanged at (4.0, 3.0) with lettuce 10, 9, 8. |
| **Box box_3** | unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) with spinach 5 + spinach 7. |
| **All other objects / tiles** | unchanged. |

### Assumptions made **before** executing the pick‑up

| # | Assumption | Was it proved? | Comment |
|---|------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | The robot is **co‑located** with *spinach_6* (both at (2, 1)). | ✅ proved – the robot was on that tile. |
| 2 | The robot’s **inventory is empty**, so it can receive a new item. | ✅ proved – inventory was empty. |
| 3 | The robot is **able to grasp** a floor object that it shares a tile with. | ✅ proved – the pick‑up succeeded. |
| 4 | Picking up **removes the object from the floor** and adds it to the inventory. | ✅ proved – *spinach_6* is no longer on the floor and appears in inventory. |
| 5 | The action **does not affect any other containers** (shelf, box) or other objects. | ✅ proved – shelf and box contents are unchanged. |
| 6 | No other side‑effects (e.g., movement, dropping) occur. | ✅ proved – robot stayed in place and inventory changed only as intended. |

All six assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot, already standing on the tile that held *spinach_6*, successfully grabbed it. The inventory now contains *spinach_6* and the floor no longer shows that spinach. All other objects (the lettuce‑filled shelf and the spinach‑holding box) remain exactly as they were. The world is ready for the next step – e.g., transport the spinach to the box or place it on a shelf.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Yes, the plan is completed.**  
The robot has already located spinach 6, moved to the tile (2, 1) where it was, executed a successful pick‑up, and the current inventory now contains spinach 6. All steps of the “pick up and store in inventory” plan have been achieved.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Yes, the plan is completed.**  
The robot has already located spinach 6, moved to the tile (2, 1) where it was, executed a successful pick‑up, and the current inventory now contains spinach 6. All steps of the “pick up and store in inventory” plan have been achieved.

Move to (4, 1) – walk to the tile that holds box_3.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naïve human‑only plan**

1. **Walk to the box** – step from the current tile (2, 1) to the tile that holds *box_3*:
   * move east to (3, 1)  
   * move east to (4, 1)

2. **Put the spinach into the box** – while standing on the same tile as *box_3*:
   * `put‑in spinach_6 box_3`

That’s it – two “move” actions followed by a single “put‑in” action. No extra reasoning or intermediate steps are required.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **World‑state after the last action** – *move from (2.0, 1.0) to (3.0, 1.0)*  

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (3.0, 1.0) – the robot is now one tile east of the box. |
| **Inventory** | **spinach_6** (still being carried). |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | No longer on the floor – it is in the robot’s inventory. |
| **Box box_3** | Unchanged at (4.0, 1.0) holding *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | Unchanged at (4.0, 3.0) with *lettuce_10*, *lettuce_9*, *lettuce_8*. |
| **All other objects / tiles** | Unchanged – nothing else moved or disappeared. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** the move and their outcomes  

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Tile **(3, 1)** is free / reachable (no wall, door or solid object). | ✅ proved – the robot successfully arrived at (3, 1). |
| 2 | Moving one step does **not change the inventory** (the robot keeps what it is carrying). | ✅ proved – *spinach_6* stays in the inventory. |
| 3 | Moving does **not affect container contents** (the shelf and box remain unchanged). | ✅ proved – lettuce list on the shelf and spinach list in the box are identical to before. |
| 4 | No other objects are displaced by the robot’s movement. | ✅ proved – all other objects keep their coordinates. |
| 5 | The robot can occupy a tile that is adjacent to a container (the box at (4, 1) does not block movement). | ✅ proved – the robot moved to the tile next to the box without issue. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot stepped east from (2, 1) to (3, 1). It kept *spinach_6* in its inventory, and every other object (the lettuce‑filled shelf and the spinach‑holding box) stayed exactly where they were. The world is now ready for the next step – e.g., move one more tile east to (4, 1) and **place spinach_6 into box_3**.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] **Plan status: not completed**  

*Reasoning:*  
- The current verified state shows the robot at **(3.0, 1.0)** holding **spinach_6**.  
- The target tile for the plan is **(4.0, 1.0)**, which is the location of **box_3**.  
- No move action to **(4, 1)** has been performed yet; the robot is still one tile west of the box.

You should now execute the next step, e.g.:

```
move (3,1) -> (4,1)
```

After arriving at (4, 1) you can proceed with the subsequent “place spinach_6 into box_3” action.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: **Plan status: not completed**  

*Reasoning:*  
- The current verified state shows the robot at **(3.0, 1.0)** holding **spinach_6**.  
- The target tile for the plan is **(4.0, 1.0)**, which is the location of **box_3**.  
- No move action to **(4, 1)** has been performed yet; the robot is still one tile west of the box.

You should now execute the next step, e.g.:

```
move (3,1) -> (4,1)
```

After arriving at (4, 1) you can proceed with the subsequent “place spinach_6 into box_3” action.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_rationale_imaginator] **Reasoning:**  
The current focus is to reach tile (4, 1) so the robot can place spinach_6 into box_3. The robot is at (3, 1) carrying the spinach, and the box is at (4, 1). Moving one step east will place the robot on the box’s tile, directly enabling the next required place action. Recent actions have successfully moved the robot closer to the goal (from (2, 1) → (3, 1)) and have not stalled or repeated useless moves.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.

Question: Is the plan still promising? Answer no when recent actions produced no new state change, no progress toward the focused plan step, or when the agent is repeating actions that do not modify the situation.
Reasoning: **Reasoning:**  
The current focus is to reach tile (4, 1) so the robot can place spinach_6 into box_3. The robot is at (3, 1) carrying the spinach, and the box is at (4, 1). Moving one step east will place the robot on the box’s tile, directly enabling the next required place action. Recent actions have successfully moved the robot closer to the goal (from (2, 1) → (3, 1)) and have not stalled or repeated useless moves.

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is still promising.

[reflector] **World‑state after the last action** – *move from (3.0, 1.0) to (4.0, 1.0)*  

| Entity / Fact | New value |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Position** | (4.0, 1.0) – the robot is now standing on the tile that holds **box_3**. |
| **Inventory** | **spinach_6** – unchanged (the robot is still carrying the picked‑up spinach). |
| **Box box_3** | Still at (4.0, 1.0) and still contains **spinach_5** and **spinach_7** (no spinach_6 yet). |
| **Shelf shelf_4** | Unchanged at (4.0, 3.0) with lettuce 10, 9, 8. |
| **Spinach spinach_6** | No longer on the floor – it is in the robot’s inventory. |
| **All other objects / tiles** | Unchanged – nothing else moved or disappeared. |

---

### Assumptions made **before** executing the move

| # | Assumption | Verdict (proved?) | Comment |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Tile **(4, 1)** is **free / reachable** (no wall, door or solid obstacle). | ✅ proved – the robot arrived at (4, 1). |
| 2 | **Moving does not modify the inventory** (the robot keeps what it is carrying). | ✅ proved – inventory still holds *spinach_6*. |
| 3 | **Moving does not affect container contents** (the shelf and the box stay the same). | ✅ proved – box still has only *spinach_5* and *spinach_7*. |
| 4 | **No other objects are displaced** by the robot’s movement. | ✅ proved – all other objects retain their coordinates. |
| 5 | The robot can **occupy the same tile as a container** (the box does not block movement). | ✅ proved – the robot stepped onto the tile of *box_3* without error. |

All five assumptions held; none were contradicted.

---

### Short summary  

The robot moved east from (3, 1) onto the tile occupied by **box_3**. The move left the inventory unchanged (still carrying *spinach_6*) and left every other object (the lettuce‑filled shelf and the box’s contents) exactly as they were. The world is now ready for the next step – e.g., **place spinach_6 into box_3**.

What do you observe? Make sure to verify facts. Respect facts, not assumptions. What is relevant for your focused plan node? Only tell about new discouveries. (short)

[observer] **Verified observations**

- **Position** – I am standing on tile **(4.0, 1.0)** in room **main** (the same tile that holds **box_3**).  
- **Inventory** – It contains **spinach_6** (the item I just picked up).  
- **Box box_3** – Still at **(4.0, 1.0)** and currently holds **spinach_5** and **spinach_7**; **spinach_6** is **not** yet inside.  
- **Shelf shelf_4** – Unchanged at **(4.0, 3.0)** with lettuce_10, lettuce_9, lettuce_8.  

**Relevance for the current plan node**

The robot is now co‑located with **box_3** and is carrying **spinach_6**, so the next required action is to **place spinach_6 into box_3**. No other objects have changed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Provide a short reasoning before deciding.

[trial_qa_imaginator] The robot’s current state shows it is already on tile (4, 1) – the exact tile that holds **box_3**. Since the plan’s only required step was to walk to that tile, the goal has been reached.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.

Question: Is the Plan completed?
Reasoning: The robot’s current state shows it is already on tile (4, 1) – the exact tile that holds **box_3**. Since the plan’s only required step was to walk to that tile, the goal has been reached.  

**Answer:** Yes, the plan is completed.
Respond by calling yes() or no() to answer the question.

Plan:
Drop spinach_6 into box_3 – remove it from the inventory and add it to the box’s contents.
What would be the naive approach to this? Use only actions the human can execute!Tell the simpel action to archive it.

[trial_imaginator] **Naive (single‑step) solution**

The only thing you have to do now is to put the spinach you are carrying into the box that is on the same tile.

**Action:**  

```
place box_3 spinach_6
```

(Or equivalently “drop spinach_6 into box_3”.)  

Executing this action will remove *spinach_6* from the robot’s inventory and add it to the contents of **box_3**, completing the task.
