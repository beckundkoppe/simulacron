[reflector] **Facts after the action**

- Human is now at **box_6**.  
- The **table at (0,4) remains empty**.  
- No **potato** is present in the environment.

**Assumptions made**

1. Moving to box_6 would not alter the state of the table.  
2. A potato existed somewhere that could be placed on the table.  
3. The action “move to box_6” would be a step toward placing the potato.

**What proved right / wrong**

- **Right**: The move to box_6 did not change the table’s emptiness.  
- **Wrong**: There was no potato to place, so the goal of “placing a potato on the table” could not be achieved.

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
- Human moved from the table (0, 4) to box 6 (1, 1).  
- No objects were moved or interacted with.  
- The table remains empty; the key stays at (3, 1); the diamond remains in box 6; no potato exists.

**Current facts**

| Item   | Location / State |
|--------|------------------|
| Human  | box 6 (1, 1)     |
| Table  | empty (0, 4)     |
| Key    | (3, 1)           |
| Diamond| box 6 (1, 1)     |
| Potato | none             |

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. The human must be at the table to place a potato.  
2. A potato is present somewhere in the environment.  
3. The key at (3, 1) is irrelevant to the potato‑placement goal.

**Assumptions proved**

- **Wrong** – Human is not at the table, so the positional requirement is unmet.  
- **Wrong** – No potato exists, so the goal cannot be achieved.  
- **Right** – The key’s presence does not affect the potato‑placement task.

Reflect what effect the performed Actions had. What are the facts? What are assumptions about the new state? Wich assumptions that were made proved right or wrong? (short)

[reflector] **Effect of the last action**  
The agent moved from the open door at (4, 4) to **box_6** at (1, 1). No other objects changed state.

**Current facts**  
- Human is at **box_6** (1, 1).  
- Key remains on the floor at (3, 1).  
- Door at (4, 4) is open and unlocked.  
- Table at (0, 4) is empty.  
- Box 6 contains a diamond.  
- No potato is present.

**Assumptions about the new state**  
1. Moving to the door would automatically pick up the key.  
2. The door would open (become unlocked and open).  
3. A potato exists somewhere in the room.

**Assumptions proved**  
- **Wrong** – The key was not picked up; it stays at (3, 1).  
- **Right** – The door is open.  
- **Wrong** – No potato is present, so the potato‑placement goal cannot be achieved.

[reflector] **Effect of the performed actions**

| Action | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `open door_8` | Door at (4, 4) becomes **open** (remains unlocked). |
| `move to box_6` | Agent moves into box_6 at (1, 1). |
| `collect diamond_5` | Diamond removed from box_6 and added to the agent’s inventory. |

**Current facts**

- Human is inside **box_6** (1, 1).  
- **Key** remains on the floor at (3, 1).  
- **Door** at (4, 4) is **open** and **unlocked**.  
- **Table** at (0, 4) is still **empty**.  
- **Diamond** is in the agent’s inventory.  
- No **potato** is present.

**Assumptions about the new state**

1. Moving to the door would automatically pick up the key.  
2. The door would open (become unlocked and open).  
3. A potato exists somewhere in the room.

**Assumptions proved**

- **Assumption 1** – *Wrong*: the key was not picked up.  
- **Assumption 2** – *Right*: the door is open.  
- **Assumption 3** – *Wrong*: no potato is present.
